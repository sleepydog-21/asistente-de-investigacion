    "text": "In the bid to survive and thrive in an environmental setting, bacterial species constantly interact and compete for resources and space in the microbial ecosystem. Thus, they have adapted to use various antibiotics and toxins to fight their rivals. Simultaneously, they have evolved an ability to withstand weapons that are directed against them. Several bacteria harbor colicinogenic plasmids which encode toxins that impair the translational apparatus. One of them, colicin E3 ribotoxin, mediates cleavage of the 16S rRNA in the decoding center of the ribosome. In order to thrive upon deployment of such ribotoxins, competing bacteria may have evolved counter-conflict mechanisms to prevent their demise. A recent study demonstrated the role of PrfH and the RtcB2 module in rescuing a damaged ribosome and the subsequent re-ligation of the cleaved 16S rRNA by colicin E3 in vitro. The",

    "text": "The establishment of synthetic microbial communities comprising complementary auxotrophic strains requires efficient transport processes for common goods. With external supplementation of the required metabolite, most auxotrophic strains reach wild-type level growth. One exception was the L-trypton auxotrophic strain phaCorynebacterium glutamicum ΔTRP ΔtrpP, which grew 35% slower than the wild type in supplemented defined media. C. glutamicum ΔTRP ΔtrpP lacks the whole L-tryptophan biosynthesis cluster (TRP, cg3359-cg3364) as well as the putative L-tryptophan transporter TrpP (Cg3357). We wanted to explore the role of TrpP in L-tryptophan transport, metabolism or regulation and to elucidate the cause of growth limitation despite supplementation. Mutants lacking either TRP or trpP revealed that the growth defect was caused solely by trpP deletion, whereas L-tryptophan auxotrophy was caused only by TRP deletion. Notably, not only the deletion but also the overexpression of trpP in an L-tryptophan producer increased the final L-tryptophan titer, arguing against a transport function of TrpP. A transcriptome comparison of C. glutamicum ΔtrpP with the wild type showed alterations in the regulon of WhcA, that contains an [Fe-S] cluster. Through evolution-guided metabolic engineering, we discovered that inactivation of SufR (Cg1765) partially complemented the growth defect caused by ΔtrpP. SufR is the transcriptional repressor of the suf operon (cg1764-cg1759), which encodes the only system of C. glutamicum for iron‒sulfur cluster formation and repair. Finally, we discovered that the combined deletion of trpP and sufR increased L-tryptophan production by almost 3-fold in comparison with the parental strain without the deletions. On the basis of our results, we exclude the possibility that TrpP is an L-tryptophan transporter. TrpP presence influences [Fe-S] cluster formation or repair, presumably through a regulatory function via direct interaction with another protein. [Fe-S] cluster availability influences not only certain enzymes but also targets of the WhiB-family regulator WhcA, which is involved in oxidative stress response. The reduced growth of WT ΔtrpP is likely caused by the reduced activity of [Fe-S]-cluster-containing enzymes involved in central metabolism, such as aconitase or succinate: menaquinone oxidoreductase. In summary, we identified a very interesting link between L-tryptophan biosynthesis and iron sulfur cluster formation that is relevant for L-tryptophan production. Not applicable.",

    "text": "Bacterial gene expression is a complex process involving extensive regulatory mechanisms. Along with growing interests in this field, Nanopore Direct RNA Sequencing (DRS) provides a promising platform for rapid and comprehensive characterization of bacterial RNA biology. However, the DRS of bacterial RNA is currently deficient in the yield of mRNA-mapping reads and has yet to be exploited for transcriptome-wide RNA modification mapping. Here, we showed that pre-processing of bacterial total RNA (size selection followed by ribosomal RNA depletion and polyadenylation) guaranteed high throughputs of sequencing data and considerably increased the amount of mRNA reads. This way, complex transcriptome architectures were reconstructed for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus and extended the boundaries of 225 known E. coli operons and 89 defined S. aureus operons. Utilizing unmodified in vitro-transcribed (IVT) RNA libraries as a negative control, several Nanopore-based computational tools globally detected putative modification sites in the E. coli and S. aureus transcriptomes. Combined with Next-Generation Sequencing-based N6-methyladenosine (m6A) detection methods, 75 high-confidence m6A candidates were identified in the E. coli protein-coding transcripts, while none were detected in S. aureus. Altogether, we demonstrated the potential of Nanopore DRS in systematic and convenient transcriptome and epitranscriptome analysis.",

    "text": "The most common causes of mitochondrial dysfunction and disease include mutations in subunits and assembly factors of Complex I. Numerous mutations in the mitochondrial gene ND1 have been identified in humans. Currently, a bacterial model system provides the only method for rapid construction and analysis of mutations in homologs of human ND1. In this report, we have identified nine mutations in human ND1 that are reported to be pathogenic and are located at subunit interfaces. Our hypothesis was that these mutations would disrupt Complex I assembly. Seventeen mutations were constructed in the homologous nuoH gene in an E. coli model system. In addition to the clinical mutations, alanine substitutions were constructed in order to distinguish between a deleterious effect from the introduction of the mutant residue and the loss of the original residue. The mutations were moved to an expression vector containing all thirteen genes of the E. coli nuo operon coding for Complex I. Membrane vesicles were prepared and rates of deamino-NADH oxidase activity and proton translocation were measured. Samples were also tested for assembly by native gel electrophoresis and for expression of NuoH by immunoblotting. A range of outcomes was observed: Mutations at four of the sites allow normal assembly with moderate activity (50−76% of wild type). Mutations at the other sites disrupt assembly and/or activity, and in some cases the outcomes depend upon the amino acid introduced. In general, the outcomes are consistent with the proposed pathogenicity in humans.",

    "text": "It was necessary to have a tool that could predict the amount of protein and optimize the gene sequences to produce recombinant proteins efficiently. The Transim model published by Tuller et al. in 2018 can calculate the translation rate in E. coli using features on the mRNA sequence, achieving a Spearman correlation with the amount of protein per mRNA of 0.36 when tested on the dataset of operons' first genes in E. coli K-12 MG1655 genome. However, this Spearman correlation was not high, and the model did not fully consider the features of mRNA and protein sequences. Therefore, to enhance the prediction capability, our study firstly tried expanding the testing dataset, adding genes inside the operon, and using the microarray of the mRNA expression data set, thereby helping to improve the correlation of translation rate with the amount of protein with more than 0.42. Next, the applicability of 6 traditional machine learning models to calculate a \"new translation rate\" was examined using initiation rate and elongation rate as inputs. The result showed that the SVR algorithm had the most correlated new translation rates, with Spearman correlation improving to R = 0.6699 with protein level output and to R = 0.6536 with protein level per mRNA. Finally, the study investigated the degree of improvement when combining more features with the new translation rates. The results showed that the model's predictive ability to produce a protein per mRNA reached R = 0.6660 when using six features, while the correlation of this model's final translation rate to protein level was up to R = 0.6729. This demonstrated the model's capability to predict protein expression of a gene, rather than being limited to predicting expression by an mRNA and showed the model's potential for development into gene expression predicting tools.",

    "text": "Biofilms are assemblages of sessile microorganisms that form an extracellular matrix around themselves and mediate attachment to surfaces. The major component of the extracellular matrix of Uropathogenic E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae are curli fibers, making biofilms robust and resistant to antimicrobials. It is therefore imperative to screen antibiofilm compounds that can impair biofilm formation. In the present study, we investigated the curli-dependent antibiofilm activity of caffeine against UPEC strain CFT073 and commensal strain E. coli K-12MG1655.Caffeine significantly reduced the biofilm formation of both UPEC and E. coli K-12 by 86.58% and 91.80% respectively at 48 mM caffeine as determined by Crystal Violet assay. These results were further confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Caffeine significantly reduced the cytotoxicity and survivability of UPEC. Molecular docking analysis revealed a strong interaction between caffeine and curli regulator protein (Csg D) of E. coli. The qRT-PCR data also showed significant downregulation in the expression of CsgBA and the CsgDEFG operon at both 24 mM and 48 mM caffeine. The findings revealed that caffeine could inhibit E. coli biofilm formation by regulating curli assembly and thus may be used as an alternative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of chronic E. coli biofilm-related infections.",

    "text": "Many bacteria are protected by different types of polysaccharide capsules, structures formed of long repetitive glycan chains that are sometimes free and sometimes anchored to the outer membrane via lipid tails. One type, called group 4 capsule, results from the expression of the gfcABCDE-etp-etk operon in Escherichia coli. Of the proteins encoded in this operon, GfcE is thought to provide the export pore for free polysaccharide chains, but none of the proteins has been implicated in the export of chains carrying a lipid anchor. For this function, GfcD has been a focus of attention as the only outer membrane β-barrel encoded in the operon. AlphaFold predicts two β-barrel domains in GfcD, a canonical N-terminal one of 12 strands and an unusual C-terminal one of 13 strands, which features a large lateral aperture between strands β1 and β13. This immediately suggests a lateral exit gate for hydrophobic molecules into the membrane, analogous to the one proposed for the lipopolysaccharide export pore LptD. Here, we report an unsteered molecular dynamics study of GfcD embedded in the bacterial outer membrane, with the common polysaccharide anchor, lipid A, inserted in the pore of the C-terminal barrel. Our results show that the lateral aperture does not collapse during simulations and membrane lipids nevertheless do not penetrate the barrel but the lipid chains of the lipid A molecule readily exit into the membrane.",

This provides key evidence that galactose can regulate the lac operon independent of known lac operon-regulated metabolism. The enhanced capabilities of the novel auto-expression medium were documented across protein production systems including (1) increased yields for routinely expressed proteins (e.g. eGFP), (2) improved expression of human cytochrome c within a dual expression system, (3) robust auto-expression in lacZ-deficient strains producing proteins with challenging disulfide bonds, and (4) reproducible 8-fold increase in SpCas9 yields, at ≥ 95% purity. This novel medium can streamline production and improve yields for routine as well as challenging proteins, accelerating recombinant protein production and creating new opportunities in biotechnology and structural biology.",

    "text": "The Helicobacter pylori flagellar motor contains several accessory structures that are not found in the archetypal Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica motors. H. pylori hp0838 encodes a previously uncharacterized lipoprotein and is in an operon with flgP, which encodes a motor accessory protein. Deletion analysis of hp0838 in H. pylori B128 showed that the gene is not required for motility in soft agar medium, but the mutant displayed a reduced growth rate and an increased sensitivity to bacitracin, which is an antibiotic that is normally excluded by the outer membrane. Introducing a plasmid-borne copy of hp0838 into the H. pylori Δhp0838 mutant suppressed the fitness defect and antibiotic sensitivity of the strain. A variant of the Δhp0838 mutant containing a frameshift mutation in pflA, which resulted in paralyzed flagella, displayed wild-type growth rate and resistance to bacitracin, suggesting the fitness defect and antibiotic sensitivity of the Δhp0838 mutant are dependent on flagellar rotation. Comparative analysis of in-situ structures of the wild type and Δhp0838 mutant motors revealed the Δhp0838 mutant motor lacked a previously undescribed ring structure with 18-fold symmetry located near the outer membrane. Given its role in formation of the motor outer ring, HP0838 was designated FapH (flagellar accessory protein in Helicobacter pylori) and the motor accessory formed the protein was named the FapH ring. Our data suggest that the FapH ring helps to preserve outer membrane barrier function during flagellar rotation. Given that FapH homologs are present in many members of the phylum Campylobacterota, they may have similar roles in protecting the outer membrane from damage due to flagellar rotation in these bacteria.",

With the evolution of the eukaryotic translation machinery, operon structure and expression of polycistrons were largely abandoned. Whether eukaryotes still possess the ability to express polycistrons, and how they functionally activate bacterial operons acquired by horizontal DNA transfer is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that a polycistron can be rapidly activated in yeast by induction of bicistronic expression under selection. We show that induced translation of the downstream cistron in a bicistronic transcript is based on a novel type of reinitiation mediated by the 80S ribosome and triggered by inefficient stop codon recognition, and that induced bicistronic expression is stable and independent of cis-elements. These results provide key insights into the epigenetic mechanism of the pathway of activation. We also developed a yeast strain that efficiently expresses bicistronic constructs, but does not carry any genomic DNA sequence change, and utilized this strain to synthesize a high-value metabolite from a bicistronic expression construct. Together, our results reveal the capacity of yeast to express bicistrons in a previously unrecognized pathway. While this capacity is normally hidden, it can be rapidly induced by selection to improve fitness.",

An extended sputum microbiological reference standard (eMRS) was used and, in South Africa, sputum induction done. BP-LAM had higher sensitivity than LF-LAM [95% confidence interval (CI) 63% (58, 69) vs. 22% (18, 27)] and similar specificity [93% (90, 96) vs. 89% (85, 92)].

The design-locked version of BP-LAM had improved specificity than the prototype [93% (90, 96) vs. 85% (80, 88)].

    "text": "The evolution of operons has puzzled evolutionary biologists since their discovery, and many theories exist to explain their emergence, spreading, and evolutionary conservation. In this work, we suggest that DNA replication introduces a selective force for the clustering of functionally related genes on chromosomes, which we interpret as a preliminary and necessary step in operon formation. Our reasoning starts from the observation that DNA replication produces copy number variations of genomic regions, and we propose that such changes perturb metabolism. The formalization of this effect by exploiting concepts from metabolic control analysis suggests that the minimization of such perturbations during evolution could be achieved through the formation of gene clusters and operons. We support our theoretical derivations with simulations based on a realistic metabolic network, and we confirm that present-day genomes have a degree of compaction of functionally related genes, which is significantly correlated to the proposed perturbations introduced by replication. The formation of clusters of functionally related genes in microbial genomes has puzzled microbiologists since their first discovery. Here, we suggest that replication, and the copy number variations due to the replisome passage, might play a role in the process through a perturbation in metabolite homeostasis. We provide theoretical support to this hypothesis, and we found that both simulations and genomic analysis support our hypothesis.

    "text": "Conjugative plasmids, major vehicles for the spread of antibiotic resistance genes, often contain multiple toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems. However, the physiological functions of TA systems remain obscure. By studying two TA families commonly found on colistin-resistant IncI2 mcr-1-bearing plasmids, we discovered that the HicAB TA, rather than the StbDE TA, acts as a crucial addiction module to increase horizontal plasmid-plasmid competition. In contrast to the canonical type II TA systems in which the TA genes are cotranscribed and/or the antitoxin gene has an additional promoter to allow for an increased antitoxin/toxin ratio, the HicAB TA system with the toxin gene preceding the antitoxin gene employs internal transcription termination to allow for a higher toxin production. This intrinsic terminator, featuring a G/C-rich hairpin with a UUU tract, lies upstream of the antitoxin gene, introducing a unique mechanism for the enhancing toxin/antitoxin ratio. Critically, the hicAB TA significantly contributes to plasmid competition and plasmid persistence in the absence of antibiotic selection, and deleting this intrinsic terminator alone diminishes this function. These findings align with the observed high occurrence of hicAB in IncI2 plasmids and the persistence of these plasmids after banning colistin as a feed additive. This study reveals how reprogramming the regulatory circuits of TA operons impacts plasmid occupancy in the microbial community and provides critical targets for combating antibiotic resistance.",

In Escherichia coli, the multiple antibiotic resistance regulator (MarR) induces transcription upon binding to salicylic acid (SA). We generated SA-specific E. coli cell-based bioreporters utilizing the operator region of the mar operon and MarR as components of the reporter and sensing domains, respectively. Although bioreporters based on endogenous MarR and wild-type E. coli cells responded to SA, their sensitivity and selectivity were insufficient for practical sample monitoring. To improve these parameters, we genetically engineered host strains for optimal MarR expression, which enhanced the sensitivity of the biosensor to micromolar quantities of SA with increased selectivity. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the biosensor could quantify SA in environmental samples. For validation, the SA concentration in artificially contaminated SA-containing cosmetic samples was determined using the developed biosensor. Reliability assessment by comparing the concentrations determined using LC-MS/MS revealed > 90% accuracy of the bioreporters. Although bioreporters are not considered standard tools for environmental monitoring, bacterial cell-based bioreporters may serve as alternative tools owing to their affordability and simplicity. The SA biosensor developed in this study can potentially be a valuable tool for monitoring SA in environmental systems.

Mutation of cdsR results in increase of cell mobility, and a number of related genes were upregulated compared to wild type HD73.

Additionally, the motAB2 operon was discovered, which consists of homologs genes motA2 and motB2 that are like motA1 and motB1. Through promoter-lacZ fusion assays and EMSA experiments, it was discovered that CdsR directly regulates the motAB1, cheY-yrhK, lamB-cheR, yaaR-fliG2, cheV-mogR, hag1, hag2, yjbJ-flgG, and motAB2 operons by binding to their promoter regions.

L-glutamate, as a central metabolite, provides carbon backbone for diverse biological compounds besides L-arginine.

The gap of L-arginine yield indicates the regulation complexity of carbon flux and energy during the L-arginine biosynthesis. Besides endogenous biosynthesis, N-acetylglutamate, the key precursor of L-arginine, can be obtained by chemical acylation of L-glutamate with a high yield of 98%. To achieve high-yield production of L-arginine, we demonstrated a novel approach by directly feeding precursor N-acetylglutamate to engineered Escherichia coli. We reported a new approach for the high yield of L-arginine production in E. coli. Gene argA encoding N-acetylglutamate synthase was deleted to disable endogenous biosynthesis of N-acetylglutamate.

Expression of phoS is strongly induced upon phosphorus scarcity and stimulated by the transcription factor PhoP. Conversely, PhoS positively regulates PhoP translation by binding to the ribosome binding site (RBS) of phoP mRNA. PhoS can promote Bacillus biofilm formation through, at least in part, enhancing the expression of the matrix-related genes, such as the eps genes and the tapA-sipW-tasA operon.

However, plasmid acquisition can produce physiological alterations in the bacterial host, leading to potential fitness costs that determine the clinical success of bacteria-plasmid associations. In this study, we use a transcriptomic approach to characterize the interactions between a globally disseminated carbapenem resistance plasmid, pOXA-48, and a diverse collection of multidrug resistant (MDR) enterobacteria. Although pOXA-48 produces mostly strain-specific transcriptional alterations, it also leads to the common overexpression of a small chromosomal operon present in Klebsiella spp. and Citrobacter freundii strains. This operon includes two genes coding for a pirin and an isochorismatase family proteins (pfp and ifp), and shows evidence of horizontal mobilization across Proteobacteria species. Combining genetic engineering, transcriptomics, and CRISPRi gene silencing, we show that a pOXA-48-encoded LysR regulator is responsible for the plasmid-chromosome crosstalk. Crucially, the operon overexpression produces a fitness benefit in a pOXA-48-carrying MDR K. pneumoniae strain, suggesting that this crosstalk promotes the dissemination of carbapenem resistance in clinical settings.",

    "text": "Bacterial genomes are shaped by cryptic prophages, which are viral genomes integrated into the bacterial chromosome. Escherichia coli genomes have 10 prophages on average. Though usually inactive, prophage genes can profoundly impact host cell physiology. Among the phage genes in the E. coli chromosome, there are several putative transcription factors (TFs). These prophage TFs are predicted to control only phage promoters; however, their regulatory functions are not well characterized. The cohabitation of prophages and bacteria has led to conditions under which the majority of prophage genes are unexpressed, at least under normal growth conditions. We characterized a Rac prophage TF, YdaT, expression of which is normally inhibited by Rac TFs and, surprisingly, by the host global regulator OxyR. YdaT, when expressed, leads to a toxic phenotype manifested by drastic cell filamentation and cell death. We determined the binding sites and regulatory action for YdaT, finding two sites within the Rac locus, and one upstream of the host rcsA gene, which codes for the global regulator RcsA. The resulting increase in RcsA strongly impacts the bacterial RcsA/B regulon, which includes operons related to motility, capsule biosynthesis, colanic acid production, biofilm formation, and cell division. Our results provide novel insights into the host's genetic network, which appears to integrate YdaT in a complex manner, favoring its maintenance in the silenced state. The fact that the potentially toxic YdaT locus remains unmutated suggests its importance and potential benefits for the host, which may appear under stress conditions that are not yet known.",

We designed a cGAL gene trap cassette and used CRISPR/Cas9 to insert it into the target gene, creating a bicistronic operon that simultaneously expresses a truncated endogenous protein and the cGAL driver in the cells expressing the target gene. We demonstrate that our cGAL gene trap strategy robustly generated loss-of-function alleles. Combining the cGAL gene trap lines with different UAS effector strains allowed us to rescue the loss-of-function phenotype, observe the gene expression pattern, and manipulate cell activity spatiotemporally. We show that, by recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) via microinjection or genetic crossing, the cGAL gene trap lines can be further engineered in vivo to easily swap cGAL with other bipartite expression systems' drivers, including QF/QF2, Tet-On/Tet-Off, and LexA, to generate new gene trap lines with different drivers at the same genomic locus. These drivers can be combined with their corresponding effectors for orthogonal transgenic control. Thus, our cGAL-based gene trap is versatile and represents a powerful genetic tool for gene function analysis in C. elegans, which will ultimately provide new insights into how genes in the genome control the biology of an organism.",

The first two genes of each CPS operon encode a locus-specific paralog of transcription elongation factor NusG (called UpxY), which enhances transcript elongation, and a UpxZ protein that inhibits noncognate UpxYs. This process, together with promoter inversions, ensures that a single CPS operon is transcribed in most cells. Here, we use in-vivo nascent-RNA sequencing and promoter-less in-vitro transcription (PIVoT) to show that UpxY recognizes a paused RNA polymerase via sequences in both the exposed non-template DNA and the upstream duplex DNA. UpxY association is aided by 'pause-then-escape' nascent RNA hairpins. UpxZ binds non-cognate UpxYs to directly inhibit UpxY association.

The exploitation of the inherent tolerance of Pseudomonas putida KT2440, an obligate aerobic bacterium, to microaerobic conditions has received little attention so far. Here low-oxygen inducible promoters were characterized in biosensor strains and exploited for process control under reduction of foam formation by low aeration and stirring rates during biosynthesis of rhamnolipids. In this study, homologous promoters of P. putida inducible under oxygen limitation were identified by non-targeted proteomic analyses and characterized by fluorometric methods. Proteomics indicated a remodeling of the respiratory chain and the regulation of stress-related proteins under oxygen limitation. Of the three promoters tested in fluorescent biosensor assays, the promoter of the oxygen-sensitive cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidase gene showed high oxygen-dependent controllability. It was used to control the gene expression of a heterologous di-rhamnolipid synthesis operon in an auto-inducing microaerobic two-phase bioprocess. By limiting the oxygen supply via low aeration and stirring rates, the bioprocess was clearly divided into a growth and a production phase, and sources of foam formation were reduced. Accordingly, rhamnolipid synthesis did not have to be controlled externally, as the oxygen-sensitive promoter was autonomously activated as soon as the oxygen level reached microaerobic conditions. A critical threshold of about 20% oxygen saturation was determined. Utilizing the inherent tolerance of P. putida to microaerobic conditions in combination with the application of homologous, low-oxygen inducible promoters is a novel and efficient strategy to control bioprocesses. Fermentation under microaerobic conditions enabled the induction of rhamnolipid production by low oxygen levels, while foam formation was limited by low aeration and stirring rates.",

Thirty P. canis and 48 P. multocida isolates were collected from dogs, cats, and humans to perform biotyping. The genotyping of P. canis by fingerprinting was followed by dendrogram construction. The whole-genome sequences (WGSs) were searched for the enzyme-coding nucleotide sequences around the main and adjacent loci constituting the operon. Full-length nucleotide sequences encoding the enzyme were determined using polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. Biotypic results were compared to the dendrogram and nucleotide sequence data. We observed a difference in trehalose fermentation with a positivity rate of 46.7%. Two (A-1/A-2) and three (B-1/B-2/B-3) clades were located on the dendrograms generated based on two repetitive sequence-based fingerprinting techniques, showing no association between trehalose fermentation and the clades. Based on the WGSs, two variants of the gene, namely, a 1,641 bp gene treC and a pseudogene (1,335 bp) of treC with its first 306 nucleotides deleted, were observed. Trehalose-positive isolates harbored treC, whereas trehalose-negative isolates lacked treC with or without the pseudogene.

    "text": "Bacterial pathogens frequently encounter host-derived metabolites during their colonization and invasion processes, which can serve as nutrients, antimicrobial agents, or signaling molecules for the pathogens. The essential nutrient choline (Cho) is widely known to be utilized by a diverse range of bacteria and may undergo conversion into the disease-associated metabolite trimethylamine (TMA). However, the impact of choline metabolism on bacterial physiology and virulence remains largely unexplored. Here, we employed an in vitro infection model to investigate the role of Cho in intracellular survival and virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). Additionally, a comprehensive RNA-seq based transcriptomic analysis and various phenotypic assays were performed to elucidate the impacts of Cho on P. aeruginosa. We observed that the Cho metabolite glycine betaine (GB) effectively reduced intracellular levels of cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP). Supplementation of Cho or GB in P. aeruginosa had thus affected c-di-GMP regulated phenotypes, such as pyoverdine production, biofilm formation, and mobility. Depletion of Cho metabolism through knockout of the betAB operon resulted in compromised intracellular survival of P. aeruginosa. Notably, the P. aeruginosa betAB mutant elicited a more robust protective inflammatory response compared to the wild-type strain. Our study showed that P. aeruginosa Cho metabolism not only interferes host nutritional immunity, but also directly affect multiple virulence phenotypes through modulation of c-di-GMP signaling.",

    "text": "The foodborne bacterium Listeria monocytogenes is transmitted to humans from various environmental sources through consumption of contaminated plant and animal-based food. L. monocytogenes uses ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type drug transporters to resist antimicrobial compounds produced by competitors co-residing in its environmental reservoirs. We have shown previously that the TimAB transporter confers resistance of L. monocytogenes to tartrolon B, a boron containing macrodiolide produced by myxo- and proteobacterial species. Tartrolon B acts as a potassium ionophore and is sensed by TimR, the transcriptional repressor of timABR operon. We here have isolated tartrolon B resistant suppressor mutations outside the timABR locus. These mutations inactivated the clpP2 gene, which encodes the main proteolytic component of house-keeping Clp proteases. Deletion of clpP2 impaired growth and virulence but caused tartrolon B hyper-resistance. This phenotype was timAB-dependent, but neither production nor degradation of TimAB was affected upon clpP2 inactivation. Combinatorial deletions of the genes encoding the three Clp ATPases showed that ClpCP2 and ClpXP2 proteasomes jointly promote tartrolon B hyper-resistance. Genetic follow-up experiments identified the ClpP2 substrate and transcription factor SpxA1 and its protease adaptor YjbH as further tartrolon B resistance determinants. SpxA1 activates transcription of the cydABCD operon encoding cytochrome oxidase and in accordance with this transposon mutants with impaired cytochrome oxidase function were depleted from a transposon mutant library during tartrolon B exposure. Our work demonstrates novel roles of Clp proteasomes, SpxA1 and cytochrome oxidase CydAB in the resistance against compounds dissipating transmembrane ion gradients and helps to better understand the genetic and chemical basis of the manifold ecological interactions of an important human pathogen in its natural ecologic niches.",

    "text": "Alpha (alpha)-hemolysin is a pore forming cytolysin and serves as a virulence factor in intestinal and extraintestinal pathogenic strains of E. coli. It was suggested that the genes encoding alpha-hemolysin (hlyCABD) which can be found on the chromosome and plasmid, were acquired through horizontal gene transfer. Plasmid-encoded alpha-hly is associated with certain enterotoxigenic (ETEC), shigatoxigenic (STEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) strains. In uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), the alpha-hly genes are located on chromosomal pathogenicity islands. Previous work suggested that plasmid and chromosomally encoded alpha-hly may have evolved independently. This was explored in our study. We have investigated 11 alpha-hly plasmids from animal and human ETEC, STEC and EPEC strains. The size of alpha-hly plasmids ranges from 48-157 kb and eight plasmids are conjugative. The regulatory gene (hlyR) located upstream of the hlyCABD gene operon and an IS911 element located downstream of hlyD are conserved. Chromosomally-encoded alpha-hly operons lack the hlyR and IS911 elements. The DNA sequence of hlyC and hlyA divided the plasmid- and chromosomally-encoded alpha-hemolysins into two clusters. The plasmid-encoded alpha-hly genes could be further divided into three groups based on the insertion of IS1 and IS2 in the regulatory region upstream of the alpha-hly operon. Transcription of the hlyA gene was higher than the housekeeping icdA gene in all strains (rq 4.8 to 143.2). Nucleotide sequence analysis of a chromosomally located alpha-hly determinant in Enterobacter cloacae strain indicates that it originates from an E. coli alpha-hly plasmid. Our data indicate that plasmids encoding alpha-hly in E. coli descended from a common ancestor independent of the plasmid size and the origin of the strains. Conjugative plasmids could contribute to the spread of the alpha-hly determinant to Enterobacter cloacae. The presence of IS-elements flanking the plasmid-encoded alpha-hly indicate that they might be mobile genetic elements.",

Microcin B17 (MccB17) is a ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptide produced by Escherichia coli. It inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase similarly to quinolone antibiotics. The mcb operon, which consists of seven genes encoding biosynthetic and immunity/export functions, was originally located on the low copy number IncFII plasmid pMccB17 in the Escherichia coli strain LP17. It was later transferred to E. coli K-12 through conjugation. In this study, the plasmid was extracted from the E. coli K-12 strain RYC1000 [pMccB17] and sequenced twice using an Illumina short-read method. The first sequencing was conducted with the host bacterial chromosome, and the plasmid DNA was then purified and sequenced separately. After assembly into a single contig, polymerase chain reaction primers were designed to close the single remaining gap via Sanger sequencing. The resulting complete circular DNA sequence is 69,190 bp long and includes 81 predicted genes. These genes were initially identified by Prokka and subsequently manually reannotated using BLAST. The plasmid was assigned to the F2:A-:B- replicon type with a MOBF12 group conjugation system. A comparison with other IncFII plasmids revealed a large proportion of shared genes, particularly in the conjugative plasmid backbone. However, unlike many contemporary IncFII plasmids, pMccB17 lacks transposable elements and antibiotic resistance genes. In addition to the mcb operon, this plasmid carries 25 genes of unknown function.",

Here, we examine 14 pathogen or host-pathogen differential gene expression data sets to assess whether using longer reads is warranted. A variety of data sets was used to assess what genomic attributes might affect the outcome of differential gene expression analysis including: gene density, operons, gene length, number of introns/exons and intron length. No genome attribute was found to influence the data in principal components analysis, hierarchical clustering with bootstrap support, or regression analyses of pairwise comparisons that were undertaken on the same reads, looking at all combinations of paired and unpaired reads trimmed to 36, 54, 72 and 101 bp. Read pairing had the greatest effect when there was little variation in the samples from different conditions or in their replicates (e.g. little differential gene expression). But overall, 54 and 72 bp reads were typically most similar. Given differences in costs and mapping percentages, we recommend 54 bp reads for organisms with no or few introns and 72 bp reads for all others. In a third of the data sets, read pairing had absolutely no effect, despite paired reads having twice as much data. Therefore, single-end reads seem robust for differential-expression analyses, but in eukaryotes paired-end reads are likely desired to analyse splice variants and should be preferred for data sets that are acquired with the intent to be community resources that might be used in secondary data analyses.",

The development of tools that can regulate translation will greatly expand our ability to precisely control genes across the genome. In Escherichia coli, most genes are contained in multi-gene operons, which are subject to polar effects where targeting one gene for repression leads to silencing of other genes in the same operon. These effects pose a challenge for independently regulating individual genes in multi-gene operons. Here, we use CRISPR-dCas13 to address this challenge. We find dCas13-mediated repression exhibits up to 6-fold lower polar effects compared to dCas9. We then show that we can selectively activate single genes in a synthetic multi-gene operon by coupling dCas9 transcriptional activation of an operon with dCas13 translational repression of individual genes within the operon. We also show that dCas13 and dCas9 can be multiplexed for improved biosynthesis of a medically-relevant human milk oligosaccharide. Taken together, our findings suggest that combining transcriptional and translational control can access effects that are difficult to achieve with either mode independently. These combined tools for gene regulation will expand our abilities to precisely engineer bacteria for biotechnology and perform systematic genetic screens.",

    "text": "Bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) function in post-transcriptional regulatory responses to environmental changes. However, the lack of eukaryotic RNA interference-like machinery in bacteria has limited the systematic engineering of RNA repression. Here, we report the development of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-guided dead CRIPSR-associated protein 13a (dCas13a) ribonucleoprotein that utilizes programmable CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) to repress trans-acting and cis-acting sRNA as the target, altering regulatory mechanisms and stress-related phenotypes. In addition, we implemented a modular loop engineering of the crRNA to promote modular repression of the target gene with 92% knockdown efficiency and a single base-pair mismatch specificity. With the engineered crRNAs, we achieved targetable single-gene repression in the polycistronic operon. For metabolic application, 102 crRNAs were constructed in the biofoundry and used for screening novel knockdown sRNA targets to improve lycopene (colored antioxidant) production in Escherichia coli. The CRISPR-dCas13a system will assist as a valuable systematic tool for the discovery of novel sRNAs and the fine-tuning of bacterial RNA repression in both scientific and industrial applications.",

We designed a highly efficient gene transcription activating strategy in which the nifA gene was placed directly downstream of its regulating sequences. The NifA protein binds its regulating sequences and stimulates transcription of itself and downstream genes. Overexpressed NifA causes transcription activation by positive reinforcement. When this gene transcription activating strategy was used to overexpress NifA in Pseudomonas stutzeri DSM4166 containing the nif gene cluster, the nitrogenase activity was increased by 368 folds which was 16 times higher than that obtained by nifA driven by the strongest endogenous constitutive promoter. When this strategy was used to activate transcription of exogenous biosynthetic genes for the plant auxin indole-3-acetic acid and the antitumor alkaloid pigment prodigiosin in DSM4166, both of them resulted in better performance than the strongest endogenous constitutive promoter and the highest reported productions in heterologous hosts to date. Finally, we demonstrated the universality of this strategy using the positive transcriptional regulator of the psp operon, PspF, in E. coli and the pathway-specific positive transcription regulator of the polyene antibiotic salinomycin biosynthesis, SlnR, in Streptomyces albus.

    "text": "Group B Streptococcus (GBS) remains the leading bacterial cause of invasive neonatal disease, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality. New therapeutic approaches beyond antibacterial treatment to prevent neonatal disease outcomes are urgent. One significant limitation in studying GBS disease and progression is the lack of non-invasive technologies for longitudinal studies. Here, we develop and compare three bioluminescent GBS strains for in vivo pathogenic analysis. Bioluminescence is based on the luxABCDE operon on a replicative vector (luxGBS-CC17), and the red-shifted firefly luciferase on a replicative vector (fflucGBS-CC17) or integrated in the genome (glucGBS-CC17). We show that luxGBS-CC17 is suitable for in vitro analysis but does not produce a significant bioluminescent signal in infected pups. In contrast, the fflucGBS-CC17 results in a strong bioluminescent signal proportional to the organ colonisation level. However, the stability of the replicative vector depends on the route of infection, especially when pups acquire the bacteria from infected vaginal mucosa. Stable chromosomal integration of luciferase in glucGBS-CC17 leads to significant bioluminescence in both haematological and vertical infection models associated with high systemic colonisation. These strains will allow the preclinical evaluation of treatment efficacy against GBS invasive disease using whole-mouse bioluminescence imaging.",

    "text": "Urolithin A (uroA) is a polyphenol derived from the multi-step metabolism of dietary ellagitannins by the human gut microbiota. Once absorbed, uroA can trigger mitophagy and aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling pathways, altering host immune function, mitochondrial health, and intestinal barrier integrity. Most individuals harbor a microbiota capable of uroA production; however, the mechanisms underlying the dehydroxylation of its catechol-containing precursor (uroC) are unknown. Here, we use a combination of untargeted bacterial transcriptomics, proteomics, and comparative genomics to uncover an inducible uroC dehydroxylase (ucd) operon in Enterocloster species. We show that the ucd operon encodes a predicted molybdopterin-dependent enzyme complex that dehydroxylates urolithins at a specific position (9-OH). By interrogating publicly available metagenomics datasets, we observed that uroC-metabolizing Enterocloster species and ucd operon genes are prevalent in human feces. In ex vivo experiments with human fecal samples, only samples actively transcribing ucd could produce uroA, possibly explaining differences in urolithin metabolism between individuals. Collectively, this work identifies Enterocloster species and the ucd operon as important contributors to uroA production and establishes a multi-omics framework to further our mechanistic understanding of polyphenol metabolism by the human gut microbiota.",

HPV is responsible for almost all cases of cervical cancer and plays a principal role in causing other cancers including oropharynx, penis, larynx, oral cavity, anus, vulva, and vagina. The study aims to investigate the prevalence and distribution of HPV genotypes among patients referred to private laboratories in Mashhad, located in the northeast of Iran. 428 samples including 382 females (89.3%) and 46 males (10.7%) between January 10, 2022, and February 11, 2023, in Mashhad, Iran were evaluated to detect HPV and determine its genotypes. Cervical swabs and urine samples were collected from females and males, respectively. Viral DNA was extracted by using a CedExtra purification kit (cedbio, Iran) and viral genotypes were identified with a High + Low Papillomastrip kit (Operon, Spain). Mann Whitney U test and Chi-square test were accomplished for statistical analysis. From the total of 428 participants analyzed, the HPV test result was positive for 129 patients (30.1%) and negative for 299 people (69.9%). Among the participants, 115 female (30.1%) and 14 male (30.4%) were positive for HPV infection. The prevalence of HPV infection among the referring people was about 30%. The most common genotype identified was HPV-6 (10.3%), followed by HPV-16 (8.7%) and HPV-51 (7.7%), the second and third most common genotypes, respectively. Additionally, HPV-39 was detected at a frequency of 6.70%. HPV-11, HPV-61, HPV-91, and HPV-44 with a frequency of 1% were among the least genotypes identified among the patients. In line with the results of this study, the prevalence of HPV genotypes in both genders is 30%. The results likely reflect differences in the prevalence of high-risk HPV genotypes, that are less common. Also, HPV-6 and HPV-16 genotypes that are covered by the vaccine had a significant prevalence. On the other hand, with the prevalence of HPV-51 and HPV-39 genotypes in infected people who are not covered by the Gardasil (quadrivalent) vaccine, there is a risk of related cancers in the future.",

UPEC possess several virulence factors (VFs) for infecting and injuring the host. We studied the papG allele distribution, and its association with other VF genes and phylogenetic groups, amongst 836 UPEC and fecal isolates from reproductive age women. The papGII gene was highly prevalent amongst pyelonephritis isolates (68%), whilst the majority, albeit smaller proportion, of cystitis isolates (31%) harboured the papGIII gene. Among the pyelonephritis and cystitis isolates, papG positive isolates on average had higher VF gene scores, and were more likely to belong to phylogenetic group B2, than their negative counterparts. This was mostly due to the contribution of papGII isolates, which on average contained more VF genes than their papGIII counterparts, irrespective of the uro-clinical syndrome. However, the papGII isolates from the pyelonephritis cohort had higher VF gene scores than the cystitis ones, suggesting presence of possible papGII clones with differing inferred virulence potential. Furthermore, papGII isolates were more likely to possess an intact pap gene operon than their papGIII counterparts. Also of note was the high proportion of isolates with the papGI allele which was not associated with other pap operon genes; and this finding has not been described before. The association of the papGII gene with several VF genes compared to the papGIII gene, appears to explain the abundance of these genes in pyelonephritis and cystitis isolates, respectively.",

    "text": "The plasmid-borne resistance gene mcr drastically undermines the effectiveness of colistin, posing a substantial threat to public health. Although several key plasmid elements that balance mcr-1 persistence and bacterial growth are identified, the regulatory interactions between mcr-1 and host bacteria remain poorly understood. Using a genome-wide CRISPRi crRNA library, it is identified that DNA polymerase IV, dinB, is essential for controlling the fitness cost associated with mcr-1 in Escherichia coli. The absence of dinB operon enhances mcr-1-mediated colistin resistance but simultaneously compromises bacterial growth and competitiveness. Meanwhile, dinB deficiency mitigates inflammatory response in RAW267.4 cells and enhances bacterial colonization in murine tissues. Further investigation reveals that mcr-1 actively upregulates dinB expression, with the increased reactive oxygen species induced by mcr-1 being crucial for this activation.   These findings suggest that dinB modulates mcr expression and bacterial fitness via a negative feedback regulatory mechanism. Leveraging this regulatory relationship, a Toxin-Intein is engineered under the control of dinB promoter to selectively target and kill mcr-positive E. coli both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, the work uncovers a novel adaptive mechanism underlying mcr persistence and provides a precise antimicrobial strategy to combat antibiotic-resistant pathogens.",

Despite advances in understanding gene regulation at the molecular level, we still lack a framework to describe how feedback mechanisms resulting from the interdependence between expression of resistance and cell metabolism can amplify naturally occurring noise and create heterogeneity at the population level.

    "text": "Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is a zoonotic disease caused by Leishmania infantum. Although usually transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies, infection by vertical transmission and by blood transfusion have also been reported. We describe the very early onset of clinical leishmaniosis, starting from 2 months of age, in a litter of pups born to an infected dam and sire. Seven pups from the litter of nine living in different households showed alopecic, exfoliative dermatitis and ulcerative cutaneous lesions. All pups and both parents were tested on at least one occasion both serologically, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the Leishmania ribosomal operon internal transcribed spacer 1 region and a short fragment of the kinetoplast minicircle; positive amplicons were sequenced. All nine pups were PCR positive for L. infantum verified by DNA sequencing, seven were positive by conjunctival, five by blood, four by lymph node, and one by skin PCR from an ulcerative lesion. Both pups with no clinical signs were seronegative, while five of the seven pups with dermatologic abnormalities were seropositive by ELISA. The sire had typical clinical dermatologic and visceral findings of CanL, was seropositive and PCR positive for L. infantum in the lymph node and fluid from the vas deferens tested after the testes were removed by castration. The dam was sub-clinically infected and seronegative, but positive by blood, lymph node and conjunctival PCR for L. infantum. Allopurinol administered to all clinically affected dogs resulted in clinical recovery. Infection with L. infantum in both parents, the very early age of clinical onset among most of the pups, and the fact that the puppies were born and detected with signs of leishmaniosis in the winter, which is a season without sand fly activity in Israel, strongly suggest vertical transmission. Awareness of the possibility of vertical transmission of L. infantum and infection in littermates should be increased. It is recommended that littermates of young dogs with clinical leishmaniosis should be tested for sub-clinical infection as they may also be infectious to sand flies and thus to other dogs and to humans. Restricting the mating of infected bitches should also be considered to prevent the vertical transmission of the infection.",

To begin understanding this process, we have devised a high-throughput in vivo assay to determine the interactions of all 11 proteins in the pNL29 GV operon. Complete or partial deletions of the operon establish interdependent relationships among GV proteins during assembly. We also examine the tolerance of the GV assembly process to protein mutations and the cellular burdens caused by GV proteins.

DAP resistance and clinical treatment failure has been associated with adaptive chromosomal mutations, but so far not with transmissible resistance traits. Here we report for the first time an acquired DAP-R determinant (named drc) that we detected in a livestock-associated Mammaliicoccus sciuri isolate. drc consists of a two-gene operon (drcAB) that is controlled by an adjacent two-component system (drcRS). The DrcAB proteins, which mediate DAP inactivation, are similar to BceAB-like antimicrobial peptide transporters of Gram-positives, but are distinct from currently known systems. The mobile drc locus is functional in various bacterial backgrounds, including MRSA. It circulates primarily among Gram-positives in the environment, but also in commensal staphylococci and enterococci, suggesting a risk of transmission into pathogens and emphasizing the importance of low and apathogenic microorganisms as resistance gene reservoirs.",

Using principles from the Escherichia coli lac operon we design analogous repression systems based on target sequence-programmable Transcription Activator-Like Effector dimer (TALED) proteins. Such engineered switches may be valuable for synthetic biology and therapeutic applications. Previous TALEDs with inducible non-covalent dimerization showed detectable, but limited, DNA loop-based repression due to the repressor protein dimerization equilibrium. Here, we show robust DNA loop-dependent bacterial promoter repression by covalent TALEDs and verify that DNA looping dramatically enhances promoter repression in E. coli. We characterize repression using a thermodynamic model that quantitates this favorable contribution of DNA looping. This analysis unequivocally and quantitatively demonstrates that optimized TALED proteins can drive loop-dependent promoter repression in E. coli comparable to the natural LacI repressor system. This work elucidates key design principles that set the stage for wide application of TALED-dependent DNA loop-based repression of target genes.",

    "text": "Bacterial type III secretion systems (T3SSs) assemble a multiprotein complex termed the injectisome, which acts as a molecular syringe for translocation of specific effector proteins into the cytoplasm of host cells. The use of injectisomes for delivery of therapeutic proteins into mammalian cells is attractive for biomedical applications. With that aim, we previously generated a non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain, called Synthetic Injector E. coli (SIEC), which assembles functional injectisomes from enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). The assembly of injectisomes in EPEC is assisted by the lytic transglycosylase EtgA, which degrades the peptidoglycan layer. As SIEC lacks EtgA, we investigated whether expression of this transglycosylase enhances the protein translocation capacity of the engineered bacterium. The etgA gene from EPEC was integrated into the SIEC chromosome under the control of the inducible tac promoter, generating the strain SIEC-eEtgA. The controlled expression of EtgA had no effect on the growth or viability of bacteria. Upon induction, injectisome assembly was ~ 30% greater in SIEC-eEtgA than in the parental strain, as determined by the level of T3SS translocon proteins, the hemolytic activity of the bacterial strain, and the impairment in flagellar motility. The functionality of SIEC-eEtgA injectisomes was evaluated in a derivative strain carrying a synthetic operon (eLEE5), which was capable of delivering Tir effector protein into the cytoplasm of HeLa cells triggering F-actin polymerization beneath the attached bacterium. Lastly, using β-lactamase as a reporter of T3SS-protein injection, we determined that the protein translocation capacity was ~ 65% higher in the SIEC-EtgA strain than in the parental SIEC strain. We demonstrate that EtgA enhances the assembly of functional injectisomes in a synthetic injector E. coli strain, enabling the translocation of greater amounts of proteins into the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. Accordingly, EtgA expression may boost the protein translocation of SIEC strains programmed as living biotherapeutics.",

    "text": "Escherichia coli is a common host for biotechnology and synthetic biology applications. During growth and fermentation, the microbes are often exposed to stress conditions, such as variations in pH or solvent concentrations. Bacterial membranes play a key role in response to abiotic stresses. Ornithine lipids (OLs) are a group of membrane lipids whose presence and synthesis have been related to stress resistance in bacteria. We wondered if this stress resistance could be transferred to bacteria not encoding the capacity to form OLs in their genome, such as E. coli. In this study, we engineered different E. coli strains to produce unmodified OLs and hydroxylated OLs by expressing the synthetic operon olsFC. Our results showed that OL formation improved pH resistance and increased biomass under phosphate limitation. Transcriptome analysis revealed that OL-forming strains differentially expressed stress- and membrane-related genes. OL-producing strains also showed better growth in the presence of the ionophore carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), suggesting reduced proton leakiness in OL-producing strains. Furthermore, our engineered strains showed improved heterologous violacein production at phosphate limitation and also at low pH. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of engineering the E. coli membrane composition for constructing robust hosts with an increased abiotic stress resistance for biotechnology and synthetic biology applications.

In this study, the genomes of two potentially new Streptomyces species isolated from a former mine heap in Tarnowskie Góry in Poland, were analyzed. A bioinformatic approach revealed notable phylogenetic and metabolic differences between the studied Streptomyces strains, despite originating from the same environment. While both strains are characterized by genetic features common to actinomycetes, additional unique biosynthetic gene clusters were also predicted in their genomes. The comparative genomic analysis with other Streptomyces spp. revealed a high conservation in heavy metal adaptive mechanisms, indicating a preadaptation to extreme conditions. The difference observed in the cad and mer operons could be attributed to the specific adaptations to heavy metal contamination. The high metal tolerance of examined strains was also confirmed by an agar dilution assay in the presence of several heavy metals. The confirmed siderophore production represents an additional mechanism allowing streptomycetes to survive in extreme conditions. On the other hand, both of studied genomes show significant differences in energy acquisition processes and the production of putative novel secondary metabolites. The isolates showed these differences not only among themselves but also compared to other Streptomyces species, indicating their uniqueness. Our results demonstrate that extreme environmental conditions can lead to the development of various adaptation mechanisms in the Streptomyces spp. Furthermore, the results indicate that diverse Streptomyces species have developed conserved adaptation mechanisms against the heavy metals under extreme conditions, indicating the emergence of preadaptations that allow bacteria to respond rapidly to polluted environments and evolve their genomes accordingly up to the evolution of new species.",

However, the respective contribution to virulence of those genes seems to depend on the genetic background and is poorly understood. Here, we analyze genomes of 232 strains of sequence type complex STc58 and show that virulence (quantified in a mouse model of sepsis) emerged in a sub-group of STc58 due to the presence of the siderophore-encoding high-pathogenicity island (HPI). When extending our genome-wide association study to 370 Escherichia strains, we show that full virulence is associated with the presence of the aer or sit operons, in addition to the HPI. The prevalence of these operons, their co-occurrence and their genomic location depend on strain phylogeny. Thus, selection of lineage-dependent specific associations of virulence-associated genes argues for strong epistatic interactions shaping the emergence of virulence in E. coli.",

RRN sequencing is emerging as a superior method for species resolution, exceeding the capabilities of short-read and full-length 16S rRNA sequencing. However, being in its early stages of development, RRN sequencing has several underexplored or understudied elements, highlighting the need for a critical and thorough examination of its methodologies. Key areas that require detailed analysis include understanding how primer pairs, sequencing platforms, and classifiers and databases affect the accuracy of species resolution achieved through RRN sequencing. Our study addresses these gaps by evaluating the effect of primer pairs using four RRN primer combinations, and that of sequencing platforms by employing PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) systems. Furthermore, two classification methods (Minimap2 and OTU clustering), in combination with four RRN reference databases (MIrROR, rrnDB, and two versions of GROND) were compared to identify consistent and accurate classification methods with RRN sequencing. Here we demonstrate that RRN primer pair choice and sequencing platform do not substantially bias taxonomic profiles for most of the tested mock communities, while classification methods significantly impact the accuracy of species-level assignments. Of the classification methods tested, Minimap2 classifier in combination with the GROND database most consistently provided accurate species-level classification across the communities tested, irrespective of sequencing platform.",

    "text": "Known for its remarkable diversity and ecological importance, the fungal kingdom remains largely unexplored. In fact, the number of unknown and undescribed fungi is predicted to exceed the number of known fungal species by far. Despite efforts to uncover these dark fungal taxa, we still face inherent sampling biases and methodological limitations. Here, we present a framework that combines taxonomic knowledge, molecular biology and data processing to explore the fungal biodiversity of enigmatic aquatic fungal lineages. Our work is based on serial screening of environmental fungal cells to approach unknown fungal taxa. Microscopic documentation is followed by DNA analysis of laser micro-dissected cells, coupled with a ribosomal operon barcoding step realised by long-read sequencing, followed by an optional whole genome sequencing step. We tested this approach on a range of aquatic fungal cells mostly belonging to the ecological group of aquatic hyphomycetes derived from environmental samples. From this initial screening, we were able to identify 60 potentially new fungal taxa in the target dataset. By extending this methodology to other fungal lineages associated with different habitats, we expect to increasingly characterise the molecular barcodes of dark fungal taxa in diverse environmental samples. This work offers a promising solution to the challenges posed by unknown and unculturable fungi and holds the potential to be applied to the diverse lineages of undescribed microeukaryotes.",

    "text": "The biofilm matrix primarily consists of proteins, exopolysaccharides, and extracellular DNA. Pseudomonas aeruginosa aminopeptidase is one of the most abundant matrix proteins in P. aeruginosa biofilms and plays a crucial role in modulating biofilm development. In a previous study, we have revealed that the loss of aminopeptidase enhances the attachment ability of P. aeruginosa. However, the mechanism by which aminopeptidase affects attachment remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that aminopeptidase is the primary protein associated with the matrix exopolysaccharide Psl. The loss of aminopeptidase leads to increased production of Psl, resulting in enhanced attachment of P. aeruginosa. Further investigation shows that aminopeptidase represses the transcription of the psl operon through the LasI/LasR quorum-sensing system, rather than via other known psl regulators or the cyclic-di-GMP signaling molecule. Aminopeptidase inhibits the transcription of lasI via the short peptides cleaved from the proform of aminopeptidase during its activation, which results in reduced biosynthesis of the quorum-sensing signaling molecule, N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone, further decreasing the production of Psl. In conclusion, our study reveals an interplay between two key matrix components via quorum-sensing signal, suggesting a mechanism by which bacteria control initial attachment and exopolysaccharide production in response to cell density.",

We performed liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer-based metabolomics using wildtype PAO1, PA1895-1897-knockout mutant, and mutant with pJN105.PA1895-1897 overexpression vector. The impact of metabolites on QS signaling molecule (3OC12-HSL and C4-HSL) concentrations, pyocyanin production, and QS gene (lasR, lasI, rhlR, and rhlI) expression was examined. Metabolomics analysis found that fatty acid biosynthesis had the highest fold enrichment among all metabolic pathways in PA1895-1897-overexpressed mutants. Among these enriched fatty acids, palmitoleic acid and acetic acid were the predominantly abundant ones that significantly affected by PA1895-1897 operon. When different doses of exogenous palmitoleic acid or acetic acid were added to the cultures of PA1895-1897 knockout mutants, their levels of 3OC12-HSL, C4-HSL, and pyocyanin were decreased in a dose-dependent manner. High doses of palmitoleic acid and acetic acid suppressed the mRNA expression of lasR, rhlR, and rhlI. Inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis increased the production of 3OC12-HSL, C4-HSL, and pyocyanin in PA1895-1897-overexpressed cultures. Our data suggest that fatty acid synthesis is promoted by PA1895-1897 operon, and contributes the delayed expression of QS phenotypes, furthering the understanding about the regulation of bacterial QS activation.",

The present survey investigated the prevalence of Anaplasma, Ehrlichia and Leishmania in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) from Portugal by molecular analysis, in order to evaluate the epidemiological role of these canids as reservoirs of infection. Blood and/or bone marrow samples were collected from 78 red foxes obtained in eight districts of northern, central and southern Portugal. Real-time polymerase chain reactions (PCR) amplified a 123 bp fragment of the 16S rRNA gene of Anaplasma spp. and Ehrlichia spp. and a 265 bp fragment of the L. infantum internal transcribed spacer one (ITS1) region of the rRNA operon evaluated by PCR-high resolution melt analysis (PCR-HRM), with sequencing of the DNA products. A phylogenetic analysis was carried out to compare these to other sequences from Anaplasma spp. and Ehrlichia spp. deposited in GenBank. A. platys was detected in 10 (14.5%) and E. canis in two (2.9%) out of 69 foxes; and L. infantum was detected in one (1.3%) of the 78 foxes. The prevalence of A. platys was significantly different from the prevalence of E. canis (p=0.016) and from that of L. infantum (p=0.002). No co-infections were found in any one of the 78 foxes. No statistically significant differences were found between the type of sample (blood and bone marrow), geographic regions (north/centre and south), age (<2 years and ≥2 years) and gender for any one of the agents. This is the first known report of A. platys in red foxes worldwide, as well as the first molecular evidence of E. canis in foxes from Portugal. The moderate prevalence of A. platys suggests that red foxes may play a role in the epidemiology of infection with this bacterium and serve as a reservoir for domestic dogs.",

    "text": "There is a critical gap in knowledge about how Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, using survival strategies developed for other niches, cause lethal bacteremia. Facultative anaerobic species of the Enterobacterales order are the most common cause of Gram-negative bacteremia, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter hormaechei. Bacteremia often leads to sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction resulting from unregulated immune responses to infection. Despite a lack of specialization for this host environment, Gram-negative pathogens cause nearly half of bacteremia cases annually. Based on our existing Tn-Seq fitness factor data from a murine model of bacteremia combined with comparative genomics of the five Enterobacterales species above, we prioritized 18 conserved fitness genes or operons for further characterization. Mutants were constructed for all genes in all five species. Each mutant was used to cochallenge C57BL/6 mice via tail vein injection along with each respective wild-type strain to determine competitive indices for each fitness gene. Five fitness factor genes, when mutated, attenuated mutants in four or five species in the spleen and liver (tatC, ruvA, gmhB, wzxE, arcA). Five additional fitness factor genes or operons were validated as outcompeted by wild-type in three, four, or five bacterial species in the spleen (xerC, prc, apaGH, atpG, aroC). Overall, 17 of 18 fitness factor mutants were attenuated in at least one species in the spleen or liver. Together, these findings allow for the development of a model of bacteremia pathogenesis that may include future targets of therapy against bloodstream infections.",

Here, we demonstrate that FruR, a DeoR family transcriptional regulator, orchestrates fru operon expression through interactions with fructose-1-phosphate (F1P) and HPr2, the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein. The F1P-HPr2(Ser-P)-FruR complex enhances RNA polymerase binding to the fru promoter, with stronger affinity for specific operator motifs compared to apo-FruR. F1P induces structural modifications in FruR that strengthen its interaction with HPr2 and alter its DNA recognition pattern, facilitating RNA polymerase access to the promoter.

The activity of YafQ and DinJ has been rigorously studied in Escherichia coli, but little has been reported about orthologous systems identified in different microorganisms. In this work, we report an in vitro and in vivo functional characterization of YafQ and DinJ identified in two different strains of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei and isolated as recombinant proteins. While DinJ is identical in both strains, the two YafQ orthologs differ only for the D72G substitution in the catalytic site. Both YafQ orthologs digest ribosomal RNA, albeit with different catalytic efficiencies, and their RNase activity is neutralized by DinJ. We further show that DinJ alone or in complex with YafQ can bind cooperatively to a 28-nt inverted repeat overlapping the -35 element of the TA operon promoter. Atomic force microscopy imaging of DinJ-YafQ in complex with DNA harboring the cognate site reveals the formation of different oligomeric states that prevent the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter. A single amino acid substitution (R13A) within the RHH DNA-binding motif of DinJ is sufficient to abolish DinJ and DinJ-YafQ DNA binding in vitro.

The function of TnaC relies on conserved residues distributed throughout the peptide, which are involved in forming an L-Trp binding site at the ribosome exit tunnel and inhibiting the ribosome function. We aimed to understand whether nonconserved amino acids surrounding these critical conserved residues play a functional role in TnaC-mediated ribosome arrest. We have isolated two intragenic suppressor mutations that restore arrest function of TnaC mutants; one of these mutations is located near the L-Trp binding site, while the other mutation is located near the ribosome active site. We used reporter gene fusions to show that both suppressor mutations have similar effects on TnaC mutants at the conserved residues involved in forming a free L-Trp binding site. However, they diverge in suppressing loss-of-function mutations in a conserved TnaC residue at the ribosome active site. With ribosome toeprinting assays, we determined that both suppressor mutations generate TnaC peptides, which are highly sensitive to L-Trp. Puromycin-challenge assays with isolated arrested ribosomes indicate that both TnaC suppressor mutants are resistant to peptidyl-tRNA cleavage by puromycin in the presence of L-Trp; however, they differ in their resistance to puromycin in the absence of L-Trp. We propose that the TnaC peptide two functionally distinct segments, a sensor domain and a stalling domain, and that the functional versatility of these domains is fine-tuned by the nature of their surrounding nonconserved residues.",

Recent genomics investigations have predicted a large untapped reservoir of bacterial terpene synthases residing in the genomes of uncultivated organisms living in the soil, indicating a vast array of putative terpenoids waiting to be discovered. We aimed to develop a high-throughput functional metagenomic screening system for identifying novel terpene synthases from bacterial metagenomes by relieving the toxicity of terpene biosynthesis precursors to the Escherichia coli host. The precursor toxicity was achieved using an inducible operon encoding the prenyl pyrophosphate synthetic pathway and supplementation of the mevalonate precursor. Host strain and screening procedures were finely optimized to minimize false positives arising from spontaneous mutations, which avoid the precursor toxicity. Our functional metagenomic screening of human fecal metagenomes yielded a novel β-farnesene synthase, which does not show amino acid sequence similarity to known β-farnesene synthases. Engineered S. cerevisiae expressing the screened β-farnesene synthase produced 120 mg/L β-farnesene from glucose (2.86 mg/g glucose) with a productivity of 0.721 g/L∙h.

To that end, we created an operon-like screening system in E. coli to select mutants of the ribosomal protein S1 with more relaxed sequence requirements for 5'-untranslated regions of mRNAs. We created two mutation libraries of the ribosomal protein S1, one covering domains 3 and 4 (D3-D4) and the second covering domains 3 to 5 (D3-D5). Most mutants from library D3-D4 proofed to be specific for a particular UTR sequence and improved only expression from a single construct. Only mutant 3 from library D3-D4 led to increased expression of four different reporters improving fluorescence levels by up to 21%. Mutants isolated from D3-D5 library led up to 90% higher expression compared to the control, though the mutants with highest improvements exhibited a specialist phenotype. The most promising mutant, mutant 4, exhibited a generalist phenotype and showed increased expression in all six reporter strains compared to the control. This could indicate the potential for a more promiscuous translation initiation of metagenomic sequences in E. coli although at the price of smaller increases compared to specialist mutants. KEY POINTS: • An operon-like selection system allowed to isolate generalist and specialist S1 mutants. • S1 mutants improved translation of mRNAs with 5'-UTRs from metagenomic sequences. • Use of S1 mutants could increase coverage from metagenomic libraries in functional screens.",

However, the pathways leading to adaptation by acquisition of de novo mutations remain poorly understood. This study explored the roles of DNA polymerase IV (dinB) and catalase HP2 (katE) in E. coli's adaptation to amoxicillin. These genes are thought to play essential roles in beta-lactam resistance-dinB in increasing mutation rates and katE in managing oxidative stress. By comparing the adaptation rates, transcriptomic profiles, and genetic changes of wild-type and knockout strains, we aimed to clarify the contributions of these genes to beta-lactam resistance. While all strains exhibited similar adaptation rates and mutations in the frdD gene and ampC operon, several unique mutations were acquired in the ΔkatE and ΔdinB strains. Overall, this study distinguishes the contributions of general stress-related genes on the one hand, and dinB, and katE on the other hand, in development of beta-lactam resistance.",

Genetic bioaugmentation, whereby the required genes are delivered to resident bacteria via horizontal gene transfer, offers a promising solution to this problem. Here, we engineered a conjugative plasmid previously isolated from soil, pQBR57, to carry a synthetic set of genes allowing bacteria to consume terephthalate, a chemical component of plastics commonly released during their manufacture and breakdown. Our engineered plasmid caused a low fitness cost and was stably maintained in terephthalate-contaminated soil by the bacterium P. putida. Plasmid carriers efficiently bioremediated contaminated soil in model soil microcosms, achieving complete breakdown of 3.2 mg/g of terephthalate within 8 days. The engineered plasmid horizontally transferred the synthetic operon to P. fluorescens in situ, and the resulting transconjugants degraded 10 mM terephthalate during a 180-h incubation. Our findings show that environmental plasmids carrying synthetic catabolic operons can be useful tools for in situ engineering of microbial communities to perform clean-up even of complex environments like soil.",

    "text": "Microorganisms in large-scale bioreactors are exposed to heterogeneous environmental conditions due to physical mixing constraints. Nutritional gradients can lead to transient expression of energetically wasteful stress responses and as a result, can reduce the titres, rates and yields of a bioprocess at larger scales. To what extent these process parameters are impacted is often unknown and therefore bioprocess scale-up comes with major risk. Designing platform strains to account for these intermittent stresses before introducing synthesis pathways is one strategy for de-risking bioprocess development. For example, Escherichia coli strain RM214 is a derivative of wild-type MG1655 that has had several genes and whole operons removed from its genome based on their metabolic cost. In this study, we engineered E. coli strain RM214 (referred to as WG02) to produce octanoic acid from glycerol in batch-flask and fed-batch bioreactor cultivations and compared it to an octanoic acid-producing E. coli MG1655 (WG01). In batch flask cultivations, the two strains performed similarly. However, in carbon limited fed-batch bioreactor cultivations, WG02 provided a greater than 22% boost to biomass compared to WG01 while maintaining similar titres of octanoic acid. Reducing the biomass accumulation of WG02 with nitrogen limited fed-batch cultivation resulted in a 16% improvement in octanoic acid titre over WG01. Finally, in a scale-down system consisting of a stirred tank reactor (representing a well-mixed zone) and plug flow reactor (representing an intermittent carbon starvation zone), WG02 again improved octanoic acid titre by almost 18% while maintaining similar biomass concentrations as WG01.",

For example, they represent an outstanding model for fabricating green metallic/metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs). In this study, two CNs (carboxylated CNs and sulfated CNs) extracted from agro-wastes of palm sheath fibers were used as templates for the facile and green synthesis of ZnO NPs by employing the sono-co-precipitation method. The obtained nanomaterials were characterized using TEM, EDX, UV-visible, DLS, FT-IR, and XRD analysis. As a result, the size and concentration of synthesized ZnO NPs were inversely proportional to one another and were affected by the CNs utilized and the reaction temperature used. Contagious diseases incited by multifarious toxigenic bacteria present severe threats to human health. The fabricated bio-nanocomposites were evaluated in terms of their antimicrobial efficacy by agar well diffusion method and broth microdilution assay, showing that CN-ZnO bio-nanocomposites were effective against the tested Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella) and Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. The influence of the subinhibitory concentrations of these suspensions on the expression of the most critical virulence toxin genes of the tested strains was effective. Significant downregulation levels were observed through toxigenic operons to both fabricated CN-ZnO bio-nanocomposites with a fold change ranging from 0.004 to 0.510, revealing a decline in the capacity and virulence of microorganisms to pose infections. Therefore, these newly fabricated CNS-ZnO bio-nanocomposites could be employed rationally in food systems as a novel preservative to inhibit microbial growth and repress the synthesis of exotoxins.",

Interestingly, GrlR overexpression exerted a strong repression effect over LEE genes in wild-type EPEC and, unexpectedly, even in the absence of H-NS, suggesting that GrlR plays an alternative repressor role. Moreover, GrlR repressed the expression of LEE promoters in a non-EPEC background. Experiments with single and double mutants showed that GrlR and H-NS negatively regulate the expression of LEE operons at two cooperative yet independent levels. In addition to the notion that GrlR acts as a repressor by inactivating GrlA through protein-protein interactions, here we showed that a DNA-binding defective GrlA mutant that still interacts with GrlR prevented GrlR-mediated repression, suggesting that GrlA has a dual role as a positive regulator by antagonizing GrlR's alternative repressor role. In line with the importance of the GrlR-GrlA complex in modulating LEE gene expression, we showed that GrlR and GrlA are expressed and interact under both inducing and repressing conditions. Further studies will be required to determine whether the GrlR alternative repressor function depends on its interaction with DNA, RNA, or another protein.

The present study explored the function of key genes in O. oeni to enhance stress resistance by heterologous expression of these genes in another species. The orf00404 gene that encodes a two-component signal transduction response regulator in O. oeni was heterologously expressed in Lactiplantibacillus plantarum WCFS1. The expression of orf00404 significantly enhanced the growth rate of the recombinant strain under acid stress. At 60 h, 72 h, and 108 h of culture at pH 4.0, the recombinant strain had 1562, 641, and 748 differentially expressed genes compared to the control strain, respectively. At all three time points, 20 genes were upregulated in the recombinant strain, including the lamA-D operon-coding genes of the quorum-sensing two component signal transduction system and the spx5 RNA polymerase-binding protein coding gene, which may help adaptation to acid stress. In addition, 47 genes were downregulated in the recombinant strain at all three time points, including the hsp1 heat shock protein-coding gene, the trxA1 thioredoxin-coding gene, and the dinP, mutY, umuC, and uvrB DNA damage repair-related protein-coding genes, potentially indicating that the recombinant strain was less susceptible to stress and had less DNA damage than the control strain in acid stress conditions. The recombinant strain had higher membrane fluidity, permeability, and integrity at an early stage of logarithmic growth (72 h), suggesting that it had a more complete and active cell membrane state at this stage. The intracellular ATP content was significantly reduced in the recombinant strain at the beginning of logarithmic growth (60 h), implying that the recombinant strain consumed more energy at this stage to resist acid stress and growth. These results indicated that the recombinant strain enhances acid stress tolerance by regulating a gene expression pattern, increasing ATP consumption, and enhancing cell membrane fluidity, membrane permeability, and membrane integrity at specific growth stages. Thus, the recombinant strain may have potential application in the microbial biotechnology industry.",

    "text": "Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression plays a crucial role in many bacterial pathways. In particular, the translation of mRNA can be regulated by trans-acting, small, non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) or mRNA-binding proteins, each of which has been successfully treated theoretically using two-component models. An important system that includes a combination of these modes of post-transcriptional regulation is the Colicin E2 system. DNA damage, by triggering the SOS response, leads to the heterogeneous expression of the Colicin E2 operon including the cea gene encoding the toxin colicin E2, and the cel gene that codes for the induction of cell lysis and release of colicin. Although previous studies have uncovered the system's basic regulatory interactions, its dynamical behavior is still unknown. Here, we develop a simple, yet comprehensive, mathematical model of the colicin E2 regulatory network, and study its dynamics. Its post-transcriptional regulation can be reduced to three hierarchically ordered components: the mRNA including the cel gene, the mRNA-binding protein CsrA, and an effective sRNA that regulates CsrA. We demonstrate that the stationary state of this system exhibits a pronounced threshold in the abundance of free mRNA. As post-transcriptional regulation is known to be noisy, we performed a detailed stochastic analysis, and found fluctuations to be largest at production rates close to the threshold. The magnitude of fluctuations can be tuned by the rate of production of the sRNA. To study the dynamics in response to an SOS signal, we incorporated the LexA-RecA SOS response network into our model. We found that CsrA regulation filtered out short-lived activation peaks and caused a delay in lysis gene expression for prolonged SOS signals, which is also seen in experiments. Moreover, we showed that a stochastic SOS signal creates a broad lysis time distribution. Our model thus theoretically describes Colicin E2 expression dynamics in detail and reveals the importance of the specific regulatory components for the timing of toxin release.",

    "text": "Cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) domains are ubiquitously prevalent in all kingdoms of life. Remarkably, in archaea, proteins consisting of solely CBS domains are widespread. However, the biological functions of CBS proteins in archaea are still unknown. Here, we identified a high hydrostatic pressure regulator (HhpR) that comprises four CBS domains serving as a transcriptional activator via specifically binding to the UAS (upstream activating sequence) motif situated within the promoter region of an operon in a hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus yayanosii under high hydrostatic pressure (HHP). By combining molecular dynamics simulations, in vitro and in vivo assays, we revealed the potential binding interfaces between HhpR and its specific DNA binding site. Particularly, one stem-loop region in HhpR (termed as 'Arm') was found to play a critical role in regulating the transcription activity, and the 192 position in the Arm region is an essential site in dictating the conformational changes of HhpR at HHP condition. Our work provides novel insights into the structure-function relationship of CBS-containing proteins that participate in archaeal gene regulation as general transcriptional activators.",

    "text": "Phosphorylation state-dependent interactions of the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) components with transcription factors play a key role in carbon catabolite repression (CCR) by glucose in bacteria. Glucose inhibits the PTS-dependent transport of fructose and is preferred over fructose in Vibrio cholerae, but the mechanism is unknown. We have recently shown that, contrary to Escherichia coli, the fructose-dependent transcriptional regulator FruR acts as an activator of the fru operon in V. cholerae and binding of the FruR-fructose 1-phosphate (F1P) complex to an operator facilitates RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding to the fru promoter. Here we show that, in the presence of glucose, dephosphorylated HPr, a general PTS component, binds to FruR. Whereas HPr does not affect DNA-binding affinity of FruR, regardless of the presence of F1P, it prevents the FruR-F1P complex from facilitating the binding of RNAP to the fru promoter. Structural and biochemical analyses of the FruR-HPr complex identify key residues responsible for the V. cholerae-specific FruR-HPr interaction not observed in E. coli. Finally, we reveal how the dephosphorylated HPr interacts with FruR in V. cholerae, whereas the phosphorylated HPr binds to CcpA, which is a global regulator of CCR in Bacillus subtilis and shows structural similarity to FruR.",

Crosstalk between gut microbes and the host plays a key role in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel diseases, yet little is known about how the miRNA-gut microbiome axis contributes to the pathogenesis of these conditions. Here, we investigate the ability of miR-21, a miRNA that we found decreased in fecal samples from IBS patients, to associate with and regulate gut microbiome function. When incubated with the human fecal microbiota, miR-21 revealed a rapid internalization or binding to microbial cells, which varied in extent across different donor samples. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting and sequencing of microbial cells incubated with fluorescently labeled miR-21 identified organisms belonging to the genera The mammalian gut represents one of the largest and most dynamic host-microbe interfaces. Host-derived microRNAs (miRNAs), released from the gut epithelium into the lumen, have emerged as important contributors to host-microbe crosstalk. Levels of several miRNAs are altered in the stool of patients with irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease. Understanding how miRNAs interact with and shape gut microbiota function is crucial as it may enable the development of new targeted treatments for intestinal diseases. This study provides evidence that the miRNA miR-21 can rapidly associate with diverse microbial cells form the gut and increase levels of transcripts involved in tryptophan synthesis in a ubiquitous gut microbe. Tryptophan catabolites regulate key functions, such as gut immune response or permeability. Therefore, this mechanism represents an unexpected host-microbe interaction and suggests that host-derived miR-21 may help regulate gut function via the gut microbiota.",

The pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme isoleucine 2-epimerase (ILEP) has been identified as the key enzyme responsible for d-BCAA biosynthesis. Comparative genomic analyses revealed that genes encoding ILEP and an uncharacterized amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC) family transporter are adjacent in several d-BCAA-producing bacteria, suggesting a functional link between these two proteins in d-BCAA metabolism. In this study, we investigated the function of the APC family transporter from Lactobacillus fermentum (LfAAP). Using heterologous expression systems in Escherichia coli and Lactococcus lactis, we demonstrated that LfAAP functions as a non-stereospecific BCAA importer. Mutational analysis revealed that Ala119 and Met331 play critical roles in substrate recognition. Heterologous expression of LfAAP and/or LfILEP in a L. lactis strain, which lacks the ILEP-AAP genes operon, revealed that ILEP functions as both synthetic and catabolic enzyme for d-BCAA. Our findings suggest that the ILEP-AAP system contribute to storage and subsequent utilization of BCAA in a form that is less accessible by other organisms, providing a potential competitive advantage in microbial environments.",

    "text": "Integrons are genetic platforms that acquire new genes encoded in integron cassettes (ICs), building arrays of adaptive functions. ICs generally encode promoterless genes, whose expression relies on the platform-associated Pc promoter, with the cassette array functioning as an operon-like structure regulated by the distance to the Pc. This is relevant in large sedentary chromosomal integrons (SCIs) carrying hundreds of ICs, like those in Vibrio species. We selected 29 gene-less cassettes in four Vibrio SCIs, and explored whether their function could be related to the transcription regulation of adjacent ICs. We show that most gene-less cassettes have promoter activity on the sense strand, enhancing the expression of downstream cassettes. Additionally, we identified the transcription start sites of gene-less ICs through 5'-RACE. Accordingly, we found that most of the superintegron in Vibrio cholerae is not silent. These promoter cassettes can trigger the expression of a silent dfrB9 cassette downstream, increasing trimethoprim resistance >512-fold in V. cholerae and Escherichia coli. Furthermore, one cassette with an antisense promoter can reduce trimethoprim resistance when cloned downstream. Our findings highlight the regulatory role of gene-less cassettes in the expression of adjacent cassettes, emphasizing their significance in SCIs and their clinical importance if captured by mobile integrons.",

Although expression is frequently controlled at the transcriptional stage, various regulation mechanisms operate at downstream levels. Here, we leverage the photoreceptor NmPAL to optogenetically induce RNA refolding and the translation of bacterial mRNAs. Blue-light-triggered NmPAL binding disrupts a cis-repressed mRNA state, thereby relieves obstruction of translation initiation, and upregulates gene expression. Iterative probing and optimization of the circuit, dubbed riboptoregulator, enhanced induction to 30-fold. Given action at the mRNA level, the riboptoregulator can differentially regulate individual structural genes within polycistronic operons. Moreover, it is orthogonal to and can be wed with other gene-regulatory circuits for nuanced and more stringent gene-expression control. We thus advance the pAurora2 circuit that combines transcriptional and translational mechanisms to optogenetically increase bacterial gene expression by >1000-fold.

    "text": "Breastfeeding is a major determinant of gut microbiota composition and fermentation activity during the first months of life. Breastmilk delivers human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) as substrates for microbial intestinal fermentation. One of the main metabolites that accumulates in feces of breastfed infants is 1,2-propanediol (1,2PD) resulting from the metabolism of fucosylated HMO. 1,2PD is used in microbial cross-feeding to produce propionate, but 1,2PD is also an alcohol that can impact the state of the microbial cell envelope. To shed further light on an understudied compound in the infant gut, we investigated the genetic and metabolic potential of the early gut colonizer Clostridium perfringens to utilise 1,2PD, and the interactions of 1,2PD with the cell envelope. Based on genome analysis, C. perfringens FMT 1006 isolated from infant feces possessed most genes of the pdu operon related to 1,2PD metabolism. C. perfringens consumed 1,2PD (78%) and produced 1-propanol as the main metabolite, while propionate was not detected. In agreement, genes responsible for 1,2PD utilisation and propanol formation (pduCDE, dhaT) were highly expressed. When cultivated in the presence of 1,2PD and glucose, a higher proportion of 1,2PD carbon (87%) was recovered as compared to incubation with only 1,2PD (34%). At the same time, lactate and acetate were formed in a ratio of 2.16:1.0 with 1,2PD and glucose compared to a ratio 9.0:1.0 during growth with only glucose possibly due to reallocation of the NAD We provide here new knowledge on the metabolism of 1,2PD by a microbial species that is present during breastfeeding and observed that C. perfringens metabolised 1,2PD mainly to propanol. The presence of 1,2PD had little impact on membrane fluidity and let to modifications of membrane lipid composition. Collectively, these findings advance our understanding of on intestinal metabolite-microbe interactions during breastfeeding.",

    "text": "Bacteria require sophisticated sensing mechanisms to adjust their metabolism in response to stressful conditions and survive in hostile environments. Among them, toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems play a crucial role in bacterial adaptation to environmental challenges. TA systems are considered as stress-responsive elements, consisting of both toxin and antitoxin genes, typically organized in operons or encoded on complementary DNA strands. A decrease in the antitoxin-toxin ratio, often triggered by specific stress conditions, leads to toxin excess, disrupting essential cellular processes and inhibiting bacterial growth. These systems are categorized into eight types based on the nature of the antitoxin (RNA or protein) and the mode of action of toxin inhibition. While the well-established biological roles of TA systems include phage inhibition and the maintenance of genetic elements, the environmental cues regulating their expression remain insufficiently documented. In this review, we highlight the diversity and complexity of the environmental cues influencing TA systems expression. A comprehensive understanding of how these genetic modules are regulated could provide deeper insights into their functions and support the development of innovative antimicrobial strategies.",

OI25 could revert to resistance when cultured in the presence of vancomycin and was thus considered to be vancomycin-variable. Long-read sequencing was used to identify structural variations within the vancomycin resistance region of OI25 and to uncover its resistance reversion mechanism. We found that OI25 has a reduced ability to positively regulate expression of the vanHAX genes in the presence of vancomycin, which was associated with the insertion of an IS6-family element within the promoter region and the first 50 bp of the vanR gene. The vancomycin-resistant revertant isolates constitutively expressed vanHAX genes at levels up to 36,000-fold greater than OI25 via co-transcription with a ribosomal RNA operon. The vancomycin-resistant revertants did not exhibit a significant growth defect. During VRE outbreaks, attention should be paid to contemporaneous vancomycin-susceptible strains as these may carry silent vancomycin resistance genes that can be activated through genomic rearrangements.",

    "text": "Bacterial gene regulatory networks orchestrate responses to environmental challenges. Horizontal gene transfer can bring in genes with regulatory potential, such as new transcription factors (TFs), and this can disrupt existing networks. Serious regulatory perturbations may even result in cell death. Here, we show the impact on Escherichia coli of importing a promiscuous TF that has adventitious transcriptional effects within the cryptic Rac prophage. A cascade of regulatory network perturbations occurred on a global level. The TF, a C regulatory protein, normally controls a Type II restriction-modification system, but in E. coli K-12 interferes with expression of the RacR repressor gene, resulting in de-repression of the normally-silent Rac ydaT gene. YdaT is a prophage-encoded TF with pleiotropic effects on E. coli physiology. In turn, YdaT alters expression of a variety of bacterial regulons normally controlled by the RcsA TF, resulting in deficient lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and cell division. At the same time, insufficient RacR repressor results in Rac DNA excision, halting Rac gene expression due to loss of the replication-defective Rac prophage. Overall, Rac induction appears to counteract the lethal toxicity of YdaT. We show here that E. coli rewires its regulatory network, so as to minimize the adverse regulatory effects of the imported C TF. This complex set of interactions may reflect the ability of bacteria to protect themselves by having robust mechanisms to maintain their regulatory networks, and/or suggest that regulatory C proteins from mobile operons are under selection to manipulate their host's regulatory networks for their own benefit.",

Specifically, there are numerous topologically coupled local reactions through which fluxes are coordinated; the global growth state often dynamically regulates many gene expression of metabolic reactions via global transcription factor regulators. Here, we develop a GSM reconstruction method, Decrem, by integrating locally coupled reactions and global transcriptional regulation of metabolism by cell state. Decrem produces predictions of flux and growth rates, which are highly correlated with those experimentally measured in both wild-type and mutants of three model microorganisms Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Bacillus subtilis under various conditions. More importantly, Decrem can also explain the observed growth rates by capturing the experimentally measured flux changes between wild-types and mutants.

    "text": "Long-read sequencing in metagenomics facilitates the assembly of complete genomes out of complex microbial communities. These genomes include essential biologic information such as the ribosomal genes or the mobile genetic elements, which are usually missed with short-reads. We applied long-read metagenomics with Nanopore sequencing to retrieve high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (HQ MAGs) from a dog fecal sample. We used nanopore long-read metagenomics and frameshift aware correction on a canine fecal sample and retrieved eight single-contig HQ MAGs, which were > 90% complete with < 5% contamination, and contained most ribosomal genes and tRNAs. At the technical level, we demonstrated that a high-molecular-weight DNA extraction improved the metagenomics assembly contiguity, the recovery of the rRNA operons, and the retrieval of longer and circular contigs that are potential HQ MAGs. These HQ MAGs corresponded to Succinivibrio, Sutterella, Prevotellamassilia, Phascolarctobacterium, Catenibacterium, Blautia, and Enterococcus genera. Linking our results to previous gastrointestinal microbiome reports (metagenome or 16S rRNA-based), we found that some bacterial species on the gastrointestinal tract seem to be more canid-specific -Succinivibrio, Prevotellamassilia, Phascolarctobacterium, Blautia_A sp900541345-, whereas others are more broadly distributed among animal and human microbiomes -Sutterella, Catenibacterium, Enterococcus, and Blautia sp003287895. Sutterella HQ MAG is potentially the first reported genome assembly for Sutterella stercoricanis, as assigned by 16S rRNA gene similarity. Moreover, we show that long reads are essential to detect mobilome functions, usually missed in short-read MAGs. We recovered eight single-contig HQ MAGs from canine feces of a healthy dog with nanopore long-reads. We also retrieved relevant biological insights from these specific bacterial species previously missed in public databases, such as complete ribosomal operons and mobilome functions. The high-molecular-weight DNA extraction improved the assembly's contiguity, whereas the high-accuracy basecalling, the raw read error correction, the assembly polishing, and the frameshift correction reduced the insertion and deletion errors.

    "text": "This longitudinal study characterized Salmonella circulating in lymph nodes (LN, n = 800) and beef trimmings (n = 745) from slaughter cattle from a Mexican feedlot. During two years, LN and beef trimming samples were collected 72-96 h post-slaughter, and we obtained 77 isolates of the serovars Anatum (n = 23), Reading (n = 22), Typhimurium (n = 10), London (n = 9), Kentucky (n = 6), Fresno (n = 4), Give, Muenster, and monophasic 1,4,[5],12:i- (n = 1 each). These isolates were subjected to whole genome sequencing, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based phylogenetic analysis, reconstruction of their ancestral isolation sources through evolutionary analysis, and virulence profiling. Although LN and beef trimmings were not mixed, evolutionary analysis estimated that the common ancestor of all study isolates was likely of LN origin. Moreover, isolates from both sources were highly clonal (0-21 SNP distance), highlighting the complexity of Salmonella transmission dynamics. The pathogen persisted across cattle cohorts, as shown by clonality between isolates collected in different years (1-20 SNP distance). Major virulence genes were highly conserved (97-100% identity to the reference sequences) and most isolates carried a conserved version of pathogenicity islands 1-5, 9, 11, and 12. Typhimurium strains carried the Salmonella plasmid virulence operon (spvRABCD), and a Muenster isolate carried the st313td gene, both of which are associated with invasive phenotypes. Most isolates (49/77) were genetically similar (1-43 SNPs) to strains involved in human salmonellosis, highlighting their public health significance. Further research is needed on Salmonella transmission dynamics in cattle and the mechanisms determining subclinical infection and persistence in farm environments.",

    "text": "Iron-sulfur clusters are ubiquitous cofactors required for fundamental biological processes. Structural and spectroscopic analysis of Fe-S proteins is often limited by low cluster occupancy in recombinantly produced proteins. In this work, we report a systematic comparison of different maturation strategies for three well-established [4Fe-4S] proteins. Aconitase B, HMBPP reductase (IspH), and quinolinate synthase (NadA) were used as model proteins as they have previously been characterized. The protein production strategies include expression of the gene of interest in BL21(DE3) cells, maturation of the apo protein using chemical or semi-enzymatic reconstitution, co-expression with two different plasmids containing the iron-sulfur cluster (isc) or sulfur formation (suf) operon, a cell strain lacking IscR, the transcriptional regulator of the ISC machinery, and an engineered \"SufFeScient\" derivative of BL21(DE3). Our results show that co-expression of a Fe-S biogenesis pathway influences the protein yield and the cluster content of the proteins. The presence of the Fe-S cluster is contributing to correct folding and structural stability of the proteins. In vivo maturation reduces the formation of Fe-S aggregates, which occur frequently when performing chemical reconstitution. Furthermore, we show that the in vivo strategies can be extended to the radical SAM protein ThnB, which was previously only maturated by chemical reconstitution. Our results shed light on the differences of in vitro and in vivo Fe-S cluster maturation and points out the pitfalls of chemical reconstitution.",

    "text": "Coupling transcription of a cloned gene to the lac operon with induction by isopropylthio-β-galactoside (IPTG) has been a favoured approach for recombinant protein expression using Escherichia coli as a heterologous host for more than six decades. Despite a wealth of experimental data gleaned over this period, a quantitative relationship between extracellular IPTG concentration and consequent levels of recombinant protein expression remains surprisingly elusive across a broad spectrum of experimental conditions. This is because gene expression under lac operon regulation is tightly correlated with intracellular IPTG concentration due to allosteric regulation of the lac repressor protein (lacY). An in-silico mathematical model established that uptake of IPTG across the cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli by simple diffusion was negligible. Conversely, lacY mediated active transport was a rapid process, taking only some seconds for internal and external IPTG concentrations to equalize. Optimizing kcat and KM parameters by targeted mutation of the galactoside binding site in lacY could be a future strategy to improve the performance of recombinant protein expression. For example, if kcat were reduced whilst KM was increased, active transport of IPTG across the cytoplasmic membrane would be reduced, thereby lessening the metabolic burden on the cell and expediating accumulation of recombinant protein. The computational model described herein is made freely available and is amenable to optimize recombinant protein expression in other heterologous hosts.

Yet, spatial co-localization or \"clustering\" of 6/7 ribosomal RNA (rrn) operons distributed over half the 4.6 Mbp genome has been captured by two other methodologies-fluorescence microscopy and Mu transposition. Our current understanding of the mechanism of clustering is limited to mapping essential cis elements. To identify trans elements, we resorted to perturbing the system by chemical and physical means and observed that heat shock disrupts clustering. Levels of σH are known to rise as a cellular response to the shock. We show that elevated expression of σH alone is sufficient to disrupt clustering, independent of heat stress. The anti-clustering activity of σH does not depend on its transcriptional activity but requires core-RNAP interaction and DNA-binding activities. This activity of σH is suppressed by ectopic expression of σD suggesting a competition for core-RNAP. A query of the other five known σ factors of E. coli found that elevated expression of FecI, the ECF σ factor that controls iron citrate transport, also perturbs clustering and is also suppressed by σD. We discuss a possible scenario for how these membrane-associated σ factors participate in clustering of distant rrn loci.",

In the context of the human microbiome, one desirable target metabolic activity are glucuronide-utilization enzymes (GUS) that are implicated in the toxic re-activation of glucuronidated compounds in the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract, including the chemotherapeutic drug irinotecan. Here, we take advantage of the variable distribution of GUS enzymes in bacteria as a means to distinguish between bacteria with GUS activity, and re-purpose the glucuronide-responsive GusR transcription factor as a biosensor to regulate dCas9 expression in response to glucuronide inducers. We fused the Escherichia coli gusA regulatory region to the dCas9 gene to create pGreg-dCas9, and showed that dCas9 expression is induced by glucuronides, but not other carbon sources. When conjugated from E. coli to Gammaproteobacteria derived from human stool, dCas9 expression from pGreg-dCas9 was restricted to GUS-positive bacteria. dCas9-sgRNAs targeted to gusA specifically down-regulated gus operon transcription in Gammaproteobacteria, with a resulting ∼100-fold decrease in GusA activity.

Cyanobacteria are promising host organisms for sustainable production of plant phenylpropanoids. We have previously engineered Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to produce trans-cinnamic acid (tCA) and p-coumaric acid (pCou), the first intermediates of phenylpropanoid pathway, by overexpression of phenylalanine- and tyrosine ammonia lyases. In this study, we aimed to enhance the production of the target compounds tCA and pCou in Synechocystis. We eliminated the 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) activity, which is a competing pathway consuming tyrosine and, possibly, phenylalanine for tocopherol synthesis. Moreover, several genes of the terminal steps of the shikimate pathway were overexpressed alone or in operons, such as aromatic transaminases, feedback insensitive cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase (TyrC) from Zymomonas mobilis and the chorismate mutase (CM) domain of the fused chorismate mutase/prephenate dehydratase enzyme from Escherichia coli. The obtained engineered strains demonstrated nearly 1.5 times enhanced tCA and pCou production when HPPD was knocked out compared to the parental production strains, accumulating 138 ± 3.5 mg L HPPD elimination enhances the tCA and pCou productivity to a similar extent. The use of PRM8 based strains as a background for overexpression of synthetic constructs, however, did not promote tCA and pCou titers, which indicates a tight regulation of the terminal steps of phenylalanine and tyrosine synthesis. This work contributes to establishing cyanobacteria as hosts for phenylpropanoid production.",

    "text": "Capnocytophaga canimorsus, a commensal bacterium of dog's mouth flora causing severe infections in humans after dog bites or scratches, has a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (endotoxin) with low-inflammatory lipid A. In particular, it contains a phosphoethanolamine (P-Etn) instead of a free phosphate group at the C-1 position of the lipid A backbone, usually present in highly toxic enterobacterial Gram-negative lipid A. Here we show that the C. canimorsus genome comprises a single operon encoding a lipid A 1-phosphatase (LpxE) and a lipid A 1 P-Etn transferase (EptA). This suggests that lipid A is modified during biosynthesis after completing acylation of the backbone by removal of the 1-phosphate and subsequent addition of an P-Etn group. As endotoxicity of lipid A is known to depend largely on the degree of unsubstituted or unmodified phosphate residues, deletion of lpxE or eptA led to mutants lacking the P-Etn group, with consequently increased endotoxicity and decreased resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMP). Consistent with the proposed sequential biosynthetic mechanism, the endotoxicity and CAMP resistance of a double deletion mutant of lpxE-eptA was similar to that of a single lpxE mutant. Finally, the proposed enzymatic activities of LpxE and EptA based on sequence similarity could be successfully validated by mass spectrometry (MS)-based analysis of lipid A isolated from the corresponding deletion mutant strains.",

    "text": "Bacterial gene expression depends on the efficient functioning of global transcriptional networks, however their interconnectivity and orchestration rely mainly on the action of individual DNA binding proteins called transcription factors (TFs). TFs interact not only with their specific target sites, but also with secondary (off-target) sites, and vary in their promiscuity. It is not clear yet what mechanisms govern the interactions with secondary sites, and how such rewiring affects the overall regulatory network, but this could clearly constrain horizontal gene transfer. Here, we show the molecular mechanism of one such off-target interaction between two unrelated TFs in Escherichia coli: the C regulatory protein of a Type II restriction-modification system, and the RacR repressor of a defective prophage. We reveal that the C protein interferes with RacR repressor expression, resulting in derepression of the toxic YdaT protein. These results also provide novel insights into regulation of the racR-ydaST operon. We mapped the C regulator interaction to a specific off-target site, and also visualized C protein dynamics, revealing intriguing differences in single molecule dynamics in different genetic contexts. Our results demonstrate an apparent example of horizontal gene transfer leading to adventitious TF cross-talk with negative effects on the recipient's viability. More broadly, this study represents an experimentally-accessible model of a regulatory constraint on horizontal gene transfer.",

The present study was designed to characterize A. patys strains in dogs from Palermo, Sicily, Italy, using a combination of PCR and sequence analysis of the 16S rDNA, heat shock operon groESL and citrate synthase (gltA) genes. Blood was collected from 344 dogs (111 pet dogs, 122 pound dogs and 111 hunting dogs) during 2003-2005 in the Province of Palermo, Sicily, Italy. The prevalence of A. platys in dogs in Sicily, as demonstrated by PCR and sequence analysis of the 16S rDNA, groESL and gltA genes, was 4%. None of the samples were positive for A. marginale, A. centrale, A. ovis and A. phagocytophilum DNA. Three different gltA genotypes of A. platys were identified in dogs from Sicily. Two of the gltA sequences of Sicilian A. platys strains were different from sequences reported previously. However, one of the gltA, 16S rDNA and groESL sequences were identical to the sequence of A. platys strains from other regions of the world characterized previously. At least three different strains of A. platys were identified in dogs from Sicily by PCR and sequence analyses of the 16S rDNA, groESL and gltA genes. The results reported herein suggested that genetic diversity of A. platys strains may be similar to A. ovis, but lower than the diversity reported for A. marginale and A. phagocytophilum. This lower genetic diversity may have resulted from restricted movement of infected hosts compared to A. marginale-infected cattle and/or the limited host range of A. ovis and A. platys as compared with A. phagocytophilum. These results expand our knowledge about A. platys and encourage further research for analysis of the genetic variation of A. platys strains worldwide.",

A semi-structured questionnaire was applied by interviewing each dog owner. Deoxyribonucleic acid obtained from ticks and dog buffy coat samples were amplified by qPCR (msp2 gene). The sequencing of 16S rRNA and groESL heat shock operon genes and a phylogenetic analysis was performed. The multiple logistic regression model was created as a function of testing positive dogs for A. phagocytophilum. Among the 398 blood samples from dogs, 6.03% were positive for A. phagocytophilum. Anaplasma phagocytophilum was detected in one A. cajennense female tick and in five R. sanguineus sensu lato ticks (four males and one female). The partial sequences of the 16S rRNA, and groESL genes obtained were highly similar to strains of A. phagocytophilum isolated from wild birds from Brazil and human pathogenic strains.

    "text": "Colonizing in the gastrointestinal tract, Escherichia coli confronts diverse acidic challenges and evolves intricate acid resistance strategies for its survival. The lysine-mediated decarboxylation (Cad) system, featuring lysine decarboxylase CadA, lysine/cadaverine antiporter CadB, and transcriptional activator CadC, plays a crucial role in E. coli's adaptation to moderate acidic stress. While the activation of the one-component system CadC and subsequent upregulation of cadBA operon in response to acid and lysine presence have been proposed, the molecular mechanisms governing the transition of CadC from an inactive to an active state remain elusive. Under neutral conditions, CadC is inhibited by forming a complex with lysine-specific permease LysP, stabilized in this inactive state by a disulfide bond. Our study unveils that, in an acidic environment, the disulfide bond in CadC is reduced by the disulfide bond isomerase DsbC, exposing R184 to periplasmic proteases, namely DegQ and DegP. Cleavage at R184 by DegQ and DegP generates an active N-terminal DNA-binding domain of CadC, which binds to the cadBA promoter, resulting in the upregulated transcription of the cadA and cadB genes. Upon activation, CadA decarboxylates lysine, producing cadaverine, subsequently transported extracellularly by CadB. We propose that accumulating cadaverine gradually binds to the CadC pH-sensing domain, preventing cleavage and activation of CadC as a feedback mechanism. The identification of DegP, DegQ, and DsbC completes a comprehensive roadmap for the activation and regulation of the Cad system in response to moderate acidic stress in E. coli.",

    "text": "Toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules are widely distributed across prokaryotes, often existing in large numbers despite their associated fitness costs. Most type II TA modules are bicistronic operons encoding a monodomain toxin and its cognate protein antitoxin. The RelE/ParE superfamily encompasses toxins with a conserved Barnase-EndoU-ColicinE5/D-RelE (BECR) fold. Yet, their cellular targets differ remarkably: RelE toxins function as ribosome-dependent RNases, while ParE toxins act as DNA gyrase inhibitors. Using a comprehensive bioinformatics approach, this study analyzed 13 BECR-fold toxin families as classified in the Pfam database. Intriguingly, the ParE family was found to include a subcluster of mRNA-cleaving toxins, challenging its conventional role as solely DNA-targeting. This study identified a novel tripartite operon encoding a PtuA-like defense ATPase, a homolog of type IV restriction endonucleases, and a RelE homolog, suggesting a coordinated role in defense mechanisms. Multidomain BECR-fold toxins, including transmembrane variants, were also discovered, extending the functional repertoire of type II TA modules to membrane-associated systems. These findings clarify the evolutionary relationships and functional diversity within the RelE/ParE superfamily and discover novel, putative defense systems that can now be investigated experimentally.IMPORTANCEToxin-antitoxin modules play critical roles in prokaryotic survival and adaptation, contributing to genome stabilization and defense against phages and invading plasmids. The RelE/ParE superfamily exemplifies the structural and functional diversity of these systems, with members targeting distinct cellular processes, such as translation and DNA supercoiling. By elucidating the relationships among the 13 BECR-fold toxin families, this study enhances our understanding of microbial resistance mechanisms and reveals potential new opportunities for research into prokaryotic defense and regulation. These insights may have significant implications for medical and biotechnological applications, particularly in understanding bacterial responses to genetic invaders.",

    "text": "Duck infectious serositis is a septicemic disease caused by the bacterium Riemerella anatipestifer (R. anatipestifer), which affects ducks, geese, turkeys, and other poultry. While outbreaks have been reported worldwide, the exact mechanisms of infection and disease progression remain unclear. Our previous research identified the two-component system PhoPR within the genome of R. anatipestifer and demonstrated its association with the bacterium's pathogenicity. Through multi-omics analysis, we found that PhoP directly regulates the expression of several genes, including moxR, within the Bacteroides aerotolerance (Bat) operon. However, the function of MoxR in R. anatipestifer has not yet been reported. To investigate the impact of MoxR on the expression of the bat operon and the pathogenicity of R. anatipestifer, we constructed ΔmoxR and other derivative strains. Our findings revealed that overexpression of MoxR inhibits the transcription of the bat operon. Conversely, deletion of moxR, along with exposure of R. anatipestifer to thermal or oxidative stress, results in increased transcription levels of the bat operon. By measuring the survival ability of each strain under stress, we discovered that MoxR is closely associated with the resistance of R. anatipestifer to thermal and oxidative stress by influencing the expression of the bat operon. Duckling infection experiments, along with adhesion and invasion assays, showed that deletion of moxR in R. anatipestifer led to decreased pathogenicity, and lower bacterial load in various tissues. Collectively, our findings collectively demonstrate the significant role of MoxR in the anti-stress and pathogenicity of R. anatipestifer, providing new insights into its pathogenic mechanisms.",

    "text": "Genetic modification of plants fundamentally relies upon customized vector designs. The ever-increasing complexity of transgenic constructs has led to increased adoption of modular cloning systems for their ease of use, cost effectiveness, and rapid prototyping. GreenGate is a modular cloning system catered specifically to designing bespoke, single transcriptional unit vectors for plant transformation-which is also its greatest flaw. MultiGreen seeks to address GreenGate's limitations while maintaining the syntax of the original GreenGate kit. The primary limitations MultiGreen addresses are 1) multiplexing in series, 2) multiplexing in parallel, and 3) repeated cycling of transcriptional unit assembly through binary intermediates. MultiGreen efficiently concatenates bespoke transcriptional units using an additional suite of level 1acceptor vectors which serve as an assembly point for individual transcriptional units prior to final, level 2, condensation of multiple transcriptional units. Assembly with MultiGreen level 1 vectors scales at a maximal rate of 2*⌈log6n⌉+3 days per assembly, where n represents the number of transcriptional units. Further, MultiGreen level 1 acceptor vectors are binary vectors and can be used directly for plant transformation to further maximize prototyping speed. MultiGreen is a 1:1 expansion of the original GreenGate architecture's grammar and has been demonstrated to efficiently assemble plasmids with multiple transcriptional units. MultiGreen has been validated by using a truncated violacein operon from Chromobacterium violaceum in bacteria and by deconstructing the RUBY reporter for in planta functional validation. MultiGreen currently supports many of our in-house multi transcriptional unit assemblies and will be a valuable strategy for more complex cloning projects.",

Utilising matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight and whole genome sequence analysis, the study identified Campylobacter jejuni (n = 46, 46.0%), C. coli (n = 39, 39%), C. lari (n = 4, 4.0%), and two novel Campylobacter species lineages (n = 11, 11%). Core genome sequence analysis provided evidence of prolonged persistence or continuous faecal shedding of closely related strains. The C. jejuni isolates displayed distinct sequence types (STs) associated with human, ruminant, and environmental sources, whereas the C. coli STs included waterborne ST3302 and ST7774. Recombination events affecting loci implicated in human pathogenesis and environmental persistence were observed, particularly in the cdtABC operon (encoding the cytolethal distending toxin) of non-human C. jejuni STs. A low diversity of antimicrobial resistance genes (aadE-Cc in C. coli), with genotype/phenotype concordance for tetracycline resistance (tetO) in three ST177 isolates, was noted. The data suggest the existence of two types of naturalised waterborne Campylobacter: environmentally persistent strains originating from waterbirds and new environmental species not linked to human campylobacteriosis.

The mechanisms underlying this remain unclear for bacteria with identical sets of metabolic genes. Here we analysed the lactose utilization operon in the murine commensal Escherichia coli 8178. Using in vitro and in vivo approaches, we showed that translation of the lactose utilization repressor gene lacI from its native non-canonical GTG start codon increases the basal expression of the lactose utilization cluster, enhancing adaptation to lactose consumption. Consequently, a strain carrying the wild type lacI GTG start codon outperformed the lacI ATG start codon mutant in the mouse intestine. This advantage was attenuated upon limiting host lactose intake through diet shift or altering the mutant frequency, emphasizing the context-dependent effect of a single nucleotide change on the bacterial fitness of a common member of the gut microbiota. Coupled with a genomic analysis highlighting the selection of non-ATG start codons in sugar utilization regulator genes across the Enterobacteriaceae family, our data exposed an unsuspected function of non-canonical start codons in metabolic competition.",

The lactose operon induction system, commonly used in Escherichia coli, relies on the binding of lactose or isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to the lactose repressor protein LacI, playing a pivotal role in controlling the lactose operon. Here, we harnessed the light-responsive light-oxygen-voltage 2 (LOV2) domain from Avena sativa phototropin 1 as a tool for light control and engineered LacI into two light-responsive variants, OptoLacIL and OptoLacID. These variants exhibit direct responsiveness to light and darkness, respectively, eliminating the need for IPTG. Building upon OptoLacI, we constructed two light-controlled E. coli gene expression systems, OptoE.coliLight system and OptoE.coliDark system. These systems enable bifunctional gene expression regulation in E. coli through light manipulation and show superior controllability compared to IPTG-induced systems. We applied the OptoE.coliDark system to protein production and metabolic flux control. Protein production levels are comparable to those induced by IPTG. Notably, the titers of dark-induced production of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) and ergothioneine exceeded 110% and 60% of those induced by IPTG, respectively. The development of OptoLacI will contribute to the advancement of the field of optogenetic protein engineering, holding substantial potential applications across various fields.",

    "text": "The canonical arsRBC genes of the ars1 operon in Pseudomonas putida KT2440, which confer tolerance to arsenate and arsenite, are followed by a series of additional ORFs culminating in phoN1. The phoN1 gene encodes an acetyltransferase that imparts resistance to the glutamine synthetase inhibitor herbicide phosphinothricin (PPT). The co-expression of phoN1 and ars genes in response to environmental arsenic, along with the physiological effects, was analysed through transcriptomics of cells exposed to the oxyanion and phenotypic characterization of P. putida strains deficient in different components of the bifan motif governing arsenic resistance in this bacterium. Genetic separation of arsRBC and phoN1 revealed that their associated phenotypes operate independently, indicating that their natural co-regulation is not functionally required for simultaneous response to the same signal. The data suggest a scenario of associative evolution, akin to Pavlovian conditioning, where two unrelated but frequently co-occurring signals result in one regulating the other's response - even if there is no functional link between the signal and the response. Such surrogate regulatory events may provide an efficient solution to complex regulatory challenges and serve as a genetic patch to address transient gaps in evolving regulatory networks.",

    "text": "Functionally related genes in bacteria are often organized and transcribed as polycistronic transcriptional units. Examples are the fim operon, which codes for biogenesis of type 1 fimbriae in Escherichia coli, and the atp operon, which codes for the FoF1 ATP synthase. We tested the hypothesis that markerless polar mutations could be efficiently engineered using CRISPR/Cas12a in these loci. Cas12a-mediated engineering of a terminator sequence inside the fimA gene occurred with efficiencies between 10 and 80% and depended on the terminator's sequence, whilst other types of mutations, such as a 97 bp deletion, occurred with 100% efficiency. Polar mutations using a terminator sequence were also engineered in the atp locus, which induced its transcriptional shutdown and produced identical phenotypes as a deletion of the whole atp locus (ΔatpIBEFHAGDC). Measuring the expression levels in the fim and atp loci showed that many supposedly non-polar mutants induced a significant polar effect on downstream genes. Finally, we also showed that transcriptional shutdown or deletion of the atp locus induces elevated levels of intracellular ATP during the exponential growth phase. We conclude that Cas12a-mediated mutagenesis is an efficient simple system to generate polar mutants in E. coli. Different mutations were induced with varying degrees of efficiency, and we confirmed that all these mutations abolished the functions encoded in the fim and atp loci. We also conclude that it is difficult to predict which mutagenesis strategy will induce a polar effect in genes downstream of the mutation site. Furthermore the strategies described here can be used to manipulate the metabolism of E. coli as showcased by the increase in intracellular ATP in the markerless ΔatpIBEFHAGDC mutant.",

We combined biophysical models and machine learning to develop steady-state and kinetic decay models of mRNA stability with high accuracy and generalizability, utilizing transcription rate models to identify mRNA isoforms and translation rate models to calculate ribosome protection.

    "text": "The study of sample taxonomic composition has evolved from direct observations and labor-intensive morphological studies to different DNA sequencing methodologies. Most of these studies leverage the metabarcoding approach, which involves the amplification of a small taxonomically-informative portion of the genome and its subsequent high-throughput sequencing. Recent advances in sequencing technology brought by Oxford Nanopore Technologies have revolutionized the field, enabling portability, affordable cost and long-read sequencing, therefore leading to a significant increase in taxonomic resolution. However, Nanopore sequencing data exhibit a particular profile, with a higher error rate compared with Illumina sequencing, and existing bioinformatics pipelines for the analysis of such data are scarce and often insufficient, requiring specialized tools to accurately process long-read sequences. We present PRONAME (PROcessing NAnopore MEtabarcoding data), an open-source, user-friendly pipeline optimized for processing raw Nanopore sequencing data. PRONAME includes precompiled databases for complete 16S sequences (Silva138 and Greengenes2) and a newly developed and curated database dedicated to bacterial 16S-ITS-23S operon sequences. The user can also provide a custom database if desired, therefore enabling the analysis of metabarcoding data for any domain of life. The pipeline significantly improves sequence accuracy, implementing innovative error-correction strategies and taking advantage of the new sequencing chemistry to produce high-quality duplex reads. Evaluations using a mock community have shown that PRONAME delivers consensus sequences demonstrating at least 99.5% accuracy with standard settings (and up to 99.7%), making it a robust tool for genomic analysis of complex multi-species communities. PRONAME meets the challenges of long-read Nanopore data processing, offering greater accuracy and versatility than existing pipelines. By integrating Nanopore-specific quality filtering, clustering and error correction, PRONAME produces high-precision consensus sequences. This brings the accuracy of Nanopore sequencing close to that of Illumina sequencing, while taking advantage of the benefits of long-read technologies.",

    "text": "Previous studies of the 70S ribosome from Flavobacterium johnsoniae revealed a novel ribosomal protein, bL38, which interacts with uL6 on the 50S subunit. This 5.6 kDa protein is conserved across the Bacteroidia and encoded downstream of bL28 and bL33 in a three-gene operon. Here, we show that bL38 is critical for the growth of F. johnsoniae, and depletion of bL38 leads to accumulation of immature 50S particles, which lack uL6 and retain precursor rRNA sequences. Cryo-EM analysis of these particles reveals several putative assembly intermediates, all showing an absence of electron density for uL6 and the entire uL12 stalk region and additional densities corresponding to the unprocessed ends of the pre-23S rRNA. Extra copies of the uL6 gene can rescue the phenotypes caused by bL38 depletion, suggesting that bL38 facilitates uL6 incorporation during 50S subunit biogenesis. Cryo-EM analysis of 50S particles from this rescued strain reveals nearly twice as many intermediates, suggesting a broader and more robust assembly landscape. Differential scanning fluorimetry shows that uL6 of F. johnsoniae is intrinsically unstable, and bL38 increases the melting temperature of uL6 by 12°C. Collectively, these data suggest that bL38 binds and stabilizes uL6, thereby promoting 50S biogenesis in the Bacteroidia.",

While the whole genome of the historically relevant Amoeba proteus has not yet been fully sequenced, we provide here a statistical analysis using protein-coding genes from transcriptomic data, suggesting that the genome size is consistent with this range, far smaller than previously claimed.

In parasitic plants, the reliance on host-derived nutrients and loss of photosynthesis in holoparasites have led to highly degraded to absent plastid genomes, but its impact on mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) evolution has remained controversial. By examining mitogenomes from 45 Orobanchaceae species including three independent transitions to holoparasitism and key evolutionary intermediates, we identified measurable and predictable genetic alterations in genomic shuffling, RNA editing, and intracellular (IGT) and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) en route to a nonphotosynthetic lifestyle. In-depth comparative analyses revealed DNA recombination and repair processes, especially RNA-mediated retroprocessing, as significant drivers for genome structure evolution. In particular, we identified a novel RNA-mediated IGT and HGT mechanism, which has not been demonstrated in cross-species and inter-organelle transfers. Based on this, we propose a generalized dosage effect mechanism to explain the biased transferability of plastid DNA to mitochondria across green plants, especially in heterotrophic lineages like parasites and mycoheterotrophs. Evolutionary rates scaled with these genomic changes, but the direction and strength of selection varied substantially among genes and clades, resulting in high contingency in mitochondrial genome evolution. Finally, we describe a universal roadmap for mitochondrial evolution in heterotrophic plants where increased recombination and repair activities, rather than relaxed selection alone, lead to differentiated genome structure compared to free-living species.",

    "text": "The ability to overcome stressful environments is critical for pathogen survival in the host. One challenge for bacteria is the exposure to reactive chlorine species (RCS), which are generated by innate immune cells as a critical part of the oxidative burst. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is the most potent antimicrobial RCS and is associated with extensive macromolecular damage in the phagocytized pathogen. However, bacteria have evolved defense strategies to alleviate the effects of HOCl-mediated damage. Among these are RCS-sensing transcriptional regulators that control the expression of HOCl-protective genes under non-stress and HOCl stress. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), the major causative agent of urinary tract infections (UTIs), is particularly exposed to infiltrating neutrophils during pathogenesis; however, their responses to and defenses from HOCl are still completely unexplored. Here, we present evidence that UPEC strains tolerate higher levels of HOCl and are better protected from neutrophil-mediated killing compared with other E. coli. Transcriptomic analysis of HOCl-stressed UPEC revealed the upregulation of an operon consisting of three genes, one of which encodes the transcriptional regulator RcrR. We identified RcrR as a HOCl-responsive transcriptional repressor, which, under non-stress conditions, is bound to the operator and represses the expression of its target genes. During HOCl exposure, however, the repressor forms reversible intermolecular disulfide bonds and dissociates from the DNA resulting in the derepression of the operon. Deletion of one of the target genes renders UPEC significantly more susceptible to HOCl and phagocytosis indicating that the HOCl-mediated induction of the regulon plays a major role for UPEC's HOCl resistance.",

    "text": "Vibrio vulnificus NCIMB2137, a Gram-negative, metalloprotease negative estuarine strain was isolated from a diseased eel. A 45 kDa chymotrypsin-like alkaline serine protease known as VvsA has been recently reported as one of the major virulence factor responsible for the pathogenesis of this strain. The vvsA gene along with a downstream gene vvsB, whose function is still unknown constitute an operon designated as vvsAB. This study examines the contribution of VvsB to the functionality of VvsA. In this study, VvsB was individually expressed using Rapid Translation System (RTS system), followed by an analysis of its role in regulating the serine protease activity of VvsA. The proteolytic activity of VvsA increased upon the addition of purified VvsB to the culture supernatant of V. vulnificus. However, the attempts of protein expression using an E. coli system revealed a noteworthy observation that protein expression from the vvsA gene exhibited higher protease activity compared to that from the vvsAB gene within the cytoplasmic fraction. These findings suggest an intricate interplay between VvsB and VvsA, where VvsB potentially interacts with VvsA inside the bacterium and suppress the proteolytic activity. While outside the bacterial milieu, VvsB appears to stimulate the activation of inactive VvsA. The findings suggest that Vibrio vulnificus regulates VvsA activity through the action of VvsB, both intracellularly and extracellularly, to ensure its survival.",

Their metacercariae were found in a variety of freshwater fishes as second intermediate hosts. Prior to this study, the genus included only 3 nominal species, 2 of them distributed in the Old World and 1 in the New World. We obtained sequences of partial mitochondrial cox1 gene and nuclear rDNA operon from new specimens collected in Europe, North and South America and used them for species comparisons and phylogenetic analysis. We also examined morphology of our newly collected specimens as well as museum specimens. Our analysis has demonstrated that at least 2 (likely 3) species of Hysteromorpha are distributed in the Americas. Hysteromorpha sp. previously sequenced from larval stages, clearly represents a new species named herein Hysteromorpha ostrowskiae n. sp. Achatz, Locke et Tkach. Morphology of adults of the new species was earlier described in sufficient detail under the name Hysteromorpha triloba (Rudolphi, 1819).

Following the discovery of the Archaea, it was soon appreciated that archaeal ribosomes were more similar to those of Eukarya rather than Bacteria. Coupled with other eukaryotic-like features, it has been suggested that the Asgard Archaea may be directly linked to eukaryotes. However, the genomes of Bacteria and non-Asgard Archaea generally organize ribosome-related genes into clusters that likely function as operons. In contrast, eukaryotes typically do not employ an operon strategy. To gain further insight into conservation of the r-protein genes, the genome order of conserved ribosomal protein (r-protein) coding genes was identified in 17 Asgard genomes (thirteen complete genomes and four genomes with less than 20 contigs) and compared with those found previously in non-Asgard archaeal and bacterial genomes.

    "text": "Bacterial transcription by RNA polymerase (RNAP) is spatially organized. RNAPs transcribing highly expressed genes locate in the nucleoid periphery, and form clusters in rich medium, with several studies linking RNAP clustering and transcription of rRNA (rrn). However, the nature of RNAP clusters and their association with rrn transcription remains unclear. Here we address these questions by using single-molecule tracking to monitor the subcellular distribution of mobile and immobile RNAP in strains with a heavily reduced number of chromosomal rrn operons (Δrrn strains). Strikingly, we find that the fraction of chromosome-associated RNAP (which is mainly engaged in transcription) is robust to deleting five or six of the seven chromosomal rrn operons. Spatial analysis in Δrrn strains showed substantial RNAP redistribution during moderate growth, with clustering increasing at cell endcaps, where the remaining rrn operons reside. These results support a model where RNAPs in Δrrn strains relocate to copies of the remaining rrn operons. In rich medium, Δrrn strains redistribute RNAP to minimize growth defects due to rrn deletions, with very high RNAP densities on rrn genes leading to genomic instability. Our study links RNAP clusters and rrn transcription, and offers insight into how bacteria maintain growth in the presence of only 1-2 rrn operons.",

    "text": "DNA transcription initiates after an RNA polymerase (RNAP) molecule binds to the promoter of a gene. In bacteria, the canonical picture is that RNAP comes from the cytoplasmic pool of freely diffusing RNAP molecules. Recent experiments suggest the possible existence of a separate pool of polymerases, competent for initiation, which freely slide on the DNA after having terminated one round of transcription. Promoter-dependent transcription reinitiation from this pool of post-termination RNAP may lead to coupled initiation at nearby operons, but it is unclear whether this can occur over the distance- and time-scales needed for it to function widely on a bacterial genome in vivo. Here, we mathematically model the hypothesized reinitiation mechanism as a diffusion-to-capture process and compute the distances over which significant inter-operon coupling can occur and the time required. These quantities depend on previously uncharacterized molecular association and dissociation rate constants between DNA, RNAP and the transcription initiation factor After transcribing an operon, a bacterial RNA polymerase can stay bound to DNA, slide along it, and reini-tiate transcription of the same or a different operon. Quantitative single-molecule biophysics experiments combined with mathematical theory demonstrate that this reinitiation process can be quick and efficient over gene spacings typical of a bacterial genome. Reinitiation may provide a mechanism to orchestrate the transcriptional activities of groups of nearby operons.",

In this study, we propose a straightforward and robust approach for the markerless integration of DNA fragments encoding whole metabolic pathways into the genome. This approach relies on the replacement of a counterselection marker with cargo DNA cassettes via λRed recombineering. We employed a counterselection strategy involving a genetic circuit based on the CI repressor of λ phage. Our design ensures elimination of most spontaneous mutants, and thus provides a counterselection stringency close to the maximum possible. We improved the efficiency of integrating long PCR-generated cassettes by exploiting the Ocr antirestriction function of T7 phage, which completely prevents degradation of unmethylated DNA by restriction endonucleases in wild-type bacteria. The employment of highly restrictive counterselection and ocr-assisted λRed recombineering allowed markerless integration of operon-sized cassettes into arbitrary genomic loci of four enterobacterial species with an efficiency of 50-100%. In the case of Escherichia coli, our strategy ensures simple combination of markerless mutations in a single strain via P1 transduction. Overall, the proposed approach can serve as a general tool for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering in a range of bacterial hosts.",

While the 16S rRNA gene, particularly its V3-V4 regions, has been extensively employed for microbial identification, however has limitations in achieving species-level resolution. Advancements in long-read sequencing technologies have highlighted the rRNA operon as a more accurate marker for microbial classification and analysis than the 16S rRNA gene. This study aims to compare the accuracy of species classification and microbial community analysis using the rRNA operon versus the 16S rRNA gene. We evaluated the species classification accuracy of the rRNA operon,16S rRNA gene, and 16S rRNA V3-V4 regions using a BLAST-based method and a k-mer matching-based method with public data available from NCBI. We further performed simulations to model microbial community analysis. We accessed the performance using each marker in community composition estimation and differential abundance analysis. Our findings demonstrate that the rRNA operon offers an advantage over the 16S rRNA gene and its V3-V4 regions for species-level classification within the genus. When applied to microbial community analysis, the rRNA operon enables a more accurate determination of composition. Using the rRNA operon yielded more reliable results in differential abundance analysis as well. We quantitatively demonstrated that the rRNA operon outperformed the 16S rRNA and its V3-V4 regions in accuracy for both individual species identification and species-level microbial community analysis.

    "text": "The production of chemicals via bio-based routes is held back by limited easy-to-use stabilisation systems. A wide range of plasmid stabilisation mechanisms can be found in the literature, however, how these mechanisms effect genetic stability and how host strains still revert to non-productive variants is poorly understood at the single-cell level. This phenomenon can generate difficulties in production-scale bioreactors as different populations of productive and non-productive cells can arise. To understand how to prevent non-productive strains from arising, it is vital to understand strain behaviour at a single-cell level. The persistence of genes located on plasmid vectors is dependent on numerous factors but can be broadly separated into structural stability and segregational stability. While structural stability refers to the capability of a cell to resist genetic mutations that bring about a loss of gene function in a production pathway, segregational stability refers to the capability of a cell to correctly distribute plasmids into daughter cells to maintain copy number. A lack of segregational stability can rapidly generate plasmid-free variants during replication, which compromises productivity. Citramalate synthase expression was linked in an operon to the expression of a fluorescent reporter to enable rapid screening of the retention of a model chemical synthesis pathway in a continuous fermentation of E. coli. Cells without additional plasmid stabilisation started to lose productivity immediately after entering the continuous phase. Inclusion of a multimer resolution site, cer, enabled a steady-state production period of 58 h before a drop in productivity was detected. Single-cell fluorescence measurements showed that plasmid-free variants arose rapidly without cer stabilisation and that this was likely due to unequal distribution of plasmid into daughter cells during cell division. The addition of cer increased total chemical yield by more than 50%. This study shows the potential remains high for plasmids to be used as pathway vectors in industrial bio-based chemicals production, providing they are correctly stabilised. We demonstrate the need for accessible bacterial 'toolkits' to enable rapid production of known, stabilised bacterial production strains to enable continuous fermentation at scale for the chemicals industry.",

However, how the coordinated actions of SRPS-related enzymes affect stoichiometric regulation remains unclear. In the present study, the first genome-wide targetome analysis is reported of these enzymes in Escherichia coli, at a single-nucleotide resolution. A strictly linear relationship is observed between the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase processing ratio and scores assigned to the first three nucleotides of the primary transcript. Stem-loops associated with PNPase targetomes exhibit a folding free energy that is negatively correlated with the termination ratio of PNPase at the 3' end. More than one-tenth of the RNase E processing sites in the 5'-untranslated regions（UTR） form different stem-loops that affect ribosome-binding and translation efficiency. The effectiveness of the SRPS elements is validated using a dual-fluorescence reporter system.

    "text": "Research on the transfer of antibiotic resistance plasmids has been mainly focused on the large multi-drug resistance conjugative plasmids, while the transmission of small mobilizable plasmids remains under-investigated. A series of diverse ColE-like kanamycin resistance plasmids (\"KanR plasmids\") from Salmonella enterica were characterized previously. In this study, the 6.6-kb pSNC3-Kan from a Salmonella enterica serotype Newport isolate was investigated. It possessed highly conserved RNA I/II and Tn602 (IS903-aph-IS903) regions to two other KanR plasmids pSe-Kan and pSBardo-Kan, but carried a mobC-mobA/BD operon. The mobilization proteins encoded by the mob operon of pSNC3-Kan showed high sequence identity (~95%) to those of an E. coli plasmid pEC34B, except that MobE was not present; and were much less conserved to those of another KanR plasmid pSN11/00Kan (43% - 86% identity). Four structurally different KanR plasmids were investigated for their ability to be mobilized by the conjugal transfer (tra) genes from F and IncP plasmids. Transfer genes derived from IncP plasmids can efficiently mobilize KanR plasmids possessing the mob operons (mobC-mobA/BD), such as pSNC3-Kan and pSN11/00Kan, in bi-parental mating experiments. On the other hand, F tra genes were able to mobilize pU302S, pSNC3-Kan and pSe-Kan, but not pSN11/00Kan. A plasmid-borne mob operon was not required for mobilization of the oriT(F)-bearing pSe-Kan by the F tra genes. This study underscores the complexity of plasmid interaction and the importance of how small mobilizable plasmids may contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes.",

    "text": "Owing to its remarkable mechanical properties that surpass the plant-based cellulose, bacterial cellulose production has been targeted for commercialization during the last few years. However, the large-scale production of cellulose is generally limited by the slow growth of producing strains and low productivity which ultimately makes the commercial production of cellulose using the conventional strains non cost-effective. In this study, we developed a novel plasmid-based expression system for the biosynthesis of cellulose in E. coli DH5α and assessed the cellulose productivity relative to the typically used E. coli BL21 (DE) expression strain. No production was detected in BL21 (DE3) cultures upon expression induction; however, cellulose was detected in E. coli DH5α as early as 1 h post-induction. The total yield in induced DH5α cultures was estimated as 200 ± 5.42 mg/L (dry weight) after 18 h induction, which surpassed the yield reported in previous studies and even the wild-type Gluconacetobacter xylinum BRC5 under the same conditions. As confirmed with electron microscope micrograph, E. coli DH5α produced dense cellulose fibers with ~ 10 μm diameter and 1000-3000 μm length, which were remarkably larger and more crystalline than that typically produced by G. hansenii. This is the first report on the successful cellulose production in E. coli DH5α which is typically used for plasmid multiplication rather than protein expression, without the need to co-express cmcax and ccpAx regulator genes present in the wild-type genome upstream the bcs-operon, and reportedly essential for the biosynthesis.",

Here, we establish the activity spectrum of nourseothricin and its main components, streptothricin F (S-F, 1 lysine) and streptothricin D (S-D, 3 lysines), purified to homogeneity, against highly drug-resistant, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) and Acinetobacter baumannii. For CRE, the MIC50 and MIC90 for S-F and S-D were 2 and 4 μM, and 0.25 and 0.5 μM, respectively. S-F and nourseothricin showed rapid, bactericidal activity. S-F and S-D both showed approximately 40-fold greater selectivity for prokaryotic than eukaryotic ribosomes in in vitro translation assays. In vivo, delayed renal toxicity occurred at >10-fold higher doses of S-F compared with S-D. Substantial treatment effect of S-F in the murine thigh model was observed against the otherwise pandrug-resistant, NDM-1-expressing Klebsiella pneumoniae Nevada strain with minimal or no toxicity. Cryo-EM characterization of S-F bound to the A. baumannii 70S ribosome defines extensive hydrogen bonding of the S-F steptolidine moiety, as a guanine mimetic, to the 16S rRNA C1054 nucleobase (Escherichia coli numbering) in helix 34, and the carbamoylated gulosamine moiety of S-F with A1196, explaining the high-level resistance conferred by corresponding mutations at the residues identified in single rrn operon E. coli. Structural analysis suggests that S-F probes the A-decoding site, which potentially may account for its miscoding activity.

Here, we report the structural and biochemical analysis of a DyP encapsulin widely found across enterobacteria. Using bioinformatic approaches, we show that this DyP encapsulin is encoded by a conserved transposon-associated operon, enriched in enterobacterial pathogens. Through low pH and peroxide exposure experiments, we highlight the stability of this DyP encapsulin under harsh conditions and show that DyP catalytic activity is highest at low pH.

    "text": "Plant-associated bacteria play important regulatory roles in modulating plant hormone auxin levels, affecting the growth and yields of crops. A conserved auxin degradation (iad) operon was recently identified in the Variovorax genomes, which is responsible for root growth inhibition (RGI) reversion, promoting rhizosphere colonization and root growth. However, the molecular mechanism underlying auxin degradation by Variovorax remains unclear. Here, we systematically screened Variovorax iad operon products and identified 2 proteins, IadK2 and IadD, that directly associate with auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Further biochemical and structural studies revealed that IadK2 is a highly IAA-specific ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter solute-binding protein (SBP), likely involved in IAA uptake. IadD interacts with IadE to form a functional Rieske non-heme dioxygenase, which works in concert with a FMN-type reductase encoded by gene iadC to transform IAA into the biologically inactive 2-oxindole-3-acetic acid (oxIAA), representing a new bacterial pathway for IAA inactivation/degradation. Importantly, incorporation of a minimum set of iadC/D/E genes could enable IAA transformation by Escherichia coli, suggesting a promising strategy for repurposing the iad operon for IAA regulation. Together, our study identifies the key components and underlying mechanisms involved in IAA transformation by Variovorax and brings new insights into the bacterial turnover of plant hormones, which would provide the basis for potential applications in rhizosphere optimization and ecological agriculture.",

    "text": "A major biofilm matrix determinant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the partially deacetylated α-1,4 linked N-acetylgalactosamine polymer, Pel. After synthesis and transport of the GalNAc polysaccharide across the inner membrane, PelA partially deacetylates and hydrolyzes Pel before its export out of the cell via PelB. While the Pel modification and export proteins are known to interact in the periplasm, it is unclear how the interaction of PelA and PelB coordinates these processes. To determine how PelA modifies the polymer, we determined its structure to 2.1 Å and found a unique arrangement of four distinct domains. We have shown previously that the hydrolase domain exhibits endo-α-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity. Characterization of the deacetylase domain revealed that PelA is the founding member of a new carbohydrate esterase family, CE21. Further, we found that the PelAB interaction enhances the deacetylation of N-acetylgalactosamine oligosaccharides. Using the PelA structure in conjunction with AlphaFold2 modeling of the PelAB complex, we propose a model wherein PelB guides Pel to the deacetylase domain of PelA and subsequently to the porin domain of PelB for export. Perturbation or loss of the PelAB interaction would result in less efficient deacetylation and potentially increased Pel hydrolysis. In PelA homologs across many phyla, the predicted structure and active sites are conserved, suggesting a common modification mechanism in Gram-negative bacterial species containing a functional pel operon.",

    "text": "The filamentous cyanobacterium Coleofasciculus chthonoplastes is the key primary producer of marine microbial mats. We elucidated the microbiomes of 32 non-axenic Coleofasciculus isolates using PacBio-based amplicon sequencing of the complete 16S rRNA gene and the internally transcribed spacer (16S-ITS). The length of authentic amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) ranged from 1827 to 3044 nucleotides (median: 2267 nt). The results, which were complemented by metagenome analyses and cultivation approaches, revealed the presence of more than 70 associated heterotrophs in the culture of Coleofasciculus sp. WW12. The great bacterial diversity in the cyanosphere is dominated by Pseudomonadota (59%) and Bacteroidota (23%). Allelic ribosomal operon variants were detected in 18 Coleofasciculus strains and our analyses proposed the presence of at least four different species. A comparative analysis of cyanobacterial microbiomes documented complementary advantages of amplicon sequencing versus metagenomics with an individual strength of the 16S-ITS approach in terms of (i) ribosomal target sequence quality, (ii) contaminant detection and (iii) identification of rare bacteria. The characterisation of the Coleofasciculus microbiome showed that long-read amplicon sequencing of the 16S-ITS region is the method of choice for rapid profiling of non-axenic cyanobacteria. Its superior resolution allows a reliable differentiation of even very closely related strains.",

    "text": "Microbiome studies using high-throughput sequencing are increasingly incorporating absolute quantitative approaches to overcome the inherent limitations of relative abundances. In this study, we have designed and experimentally validated a set of 12 unique synthetic rRNA operons, which we refer to as rDNA-mimics, to serve as spike-in standards for quantitative profiling of fungal/eukaryotic and bacterial microbiomes. The rDNA-mimics consist of conserved sequence regions from natural rRNA genes to act as binding sites for common universal PCR primers, and bioinformatically designed variable regions that allow their robust identification in any microbiome sample. All constructs cover multiple rRNA operon regions commonly targeted in fungal/eukaryotic microbiome studies (SSU-V9, ITS1, ITS2, and LSU-D1D2) and two of them also include an artificial segment of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (SSU-V4) for cross-domain application. We validated the quantitative performance of the rDNA-mimics using defined mock communities and representative environmental samples. In particular, we show that rDNA-mimics added to extracted DNA or directly to the samples prior to DNA extraction precisely reflects the total amount of fungal and/or bacterial rRNA genes in the samples. We demonstrate that this allows accurate estimation of differences in microbial loads between samples, thereby confirming that the rDNA-mimics are suitable for absolute quantitative analyses of differential microbial abundances.",

    "text": "Sugarcane molasses, rich in sucrose, glucose, and fructose, offers a promising carbon source for industrial fermentation due to its abundance and low cost. However, challenges arise from the simultaneous utilization of multiple sugars and carbon catabolite repression (CCR). Despite its nutritional content, sucrose metabolism in Escherichia coli, except for W strain, remains poorly understood, hindering its use in microbial fermentation. In this study, E. coli W was engineered to enhance sugar consumption rates and overcome CCR. This was achieved through the integration of a synthetically designed csc operon and the optimization of glucose and fructose co-utilization pathways. These advancements facilitate efficient utilization of sugarcane molasses for the production of 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP), contributing to sustainable biochemical production processes. In this study, we addressed challenges associated with sugar metabolism in E. coli W, focusing on enhancing sucrose consumption and improving glucose-fructose co-utilization. Through targeted engineering of the sucrose utilization system, we achieved accelerated sucrose consumption rates by modulating the expression of the csc operon components, cscB, cscK, cscA, and cscR. Our findings revealed that monocistronic expression of the csc genes with the deletion of cscR, led to optimal sucrose utilization without significant growth burden. Furthermore, we successfully alleviated fructose catabolite repression by modulating the binding dynamics of FruR with the fructose PTS regulon, enabling near-equivalent co-utilization of glucose and fructose. To validate the industrial applicability of our engineered strain, we pursued 3-HP production from sugarcane molasses. By integrating heterologous genes and optimizing metabolic pathways, we achieved improvements in 3-HP titers compared to previous studies. Additionally, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapA) repression aids in carbon flux redistribution, enhancing molasses conversion to 3-HP. Despite limitations in sucrose metabolism, the redesigned E. coli W strain, adept at utilizing sugarcane molasses, is a valuable asset for industrial fermentation. Its synthetic csc operon enhances sucrose consumption, while mitigating CCR improves glucose-fructose co-utilization. These enhancements, coupled with repression of gapA, aim to efficiently convert sugarcane molasses into 3-HP, addressing limitations in sucrose and fructose metabolism for industrial applications.",

Translational coupling is a common phenomenon in diverse polycistronic operons for efficient allocation of limited genetic space and cellular resources. These beneficial features of translation coupling can provide exciting opportunities for creating novel synthetic biological devices. Here, we introduce a modular synthetic translational coupling element (synTCE) and integrate this design with de novo designed riboregulators, toehold switches. A systematic exploration of sequence domain variants for synTCEs led to the identification of critical design considerations for improving the system performance. Next, this design approach was seamlessly integrated into logic computations and applied to construct multi-output transcripts with well-defined stoichiometric control. This module was further applied to signaling cascades for combined signal transduction and multi-input/multi-output synthetic devices. Further, the synTCEs can precisely manipulate the N-terminal ends of output proteins, facilitating effective protein localization and cellular population control. Therefore, the synTCEs could enhance computational capability and applicability of riboregulators for reprogramming biological systems, leading to future applications in synthetic biology, metabolic engineering and biotechnology.",

Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a well-known plant hormone, can be produced by various plant-associated bacteria. However, the prevalence of bacteria with the capacity to degrade IAA in the rhizosphere has not been systematically studied. In this study, we analyzed the IAA degradation capabilities of bacterial isolates from the roots of Arabidopsis and rice. Using genomics analysis and in vitro assays, we found that 21 out of 183 taxonomically diverse bacterial isolates possess the ability to degrade IAA. Through comparative genomics and transcriptomic assays, we identified iac-like or iad-like operon in the genomes of these IAA degraders. Additionally, the putative regulator of the operon was found to be highly conserved among these strains through protein structure similarity analysis. Some of the IAA degraders could utilize IAA as their carbon and energy source. In planta, most of the IAA degrading strains mitigated Arabidopsis and rice seedling root growth inhibition (RGI) triggered by exogenous IAA. Moreover, RGI caused by complex synthetic bacterial community can be alleviated by introducing IAA degraders. Importantly, we observed increased colonization preference of IAA degraders from soil to root according to the frequency of the biomarker genes in metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) collected from different habitats, suggesting that there is a close association between IAA degraders and IAA producers. In summary, our findings further the understanding of the functional diversity and potential biological roles of plant-associated bacteria in host plant root morphogenesis.",

Tai systems protect their bacterial host population from other phages by blocking the tail assembly step, leading to the release of tailless phages incapable of infecting new hosts. To prevent autoimmunity, some Tai-positive phages have an associated counter-defense mechanism that is expressed during the phage lytic cycle and allows for tail formation.

Here we characterise the VWA domain-protein ViaA and its interaction with the AAA+ ATPase RavA, and find that both proteins localise at the inner cell membrane. We demonstrate that RavA and ViaA target specific phospholipids and subsequently identify their lipid-binding sites. We further show that mutations abolishing interaction with lipids restore induced changes in cell membrane morphology and lipid composition. Finally we reveal that these mutations render E. coli gentamicin-resistant under fumarate respiration conditions. Our work thus uncovers a ravA-viaA-based pathway which is mobilised in response to aminoglycosides under anaerobiosis and engaged in cell membrane regulation.",

Polymyxin B (PmB), a cyclic antimicrobial peptide, is used prophylactically in livestock and as a last-resort treatment for multidrug-resistant bacterial infections in humans. In this study, a transcriptomic analysis in Vibrio cholerae showed that expression of the uncharacterized gene ompV is stimulated in response to PmB. We found that ompV is organized in a conserved four-gene operon with the two-component system carRS and virK in V. cholerae. A virK deletion mutant and an ompV deletion mutant were more sensitive to antimicrobials, suggesting that both OmpV and VirK contribute to antimicrobial resistance. Our transcriptomic analysis showed that the efflux pump vexAB, a known effector of PmB resistance, was upregulated in an ompV-dependent manner in the presence of PmB. The predicted structure of OmpV revealed a lateral opening in the β-barrel wall with access to an electronegative pocket in the barrel lumen that can accommodate PmB. Such an interaction could facilitate intracellular signaling through a conformational change in OmpV.

Thus, their role as transcription factors may involve three-dimensional chromosome re-organisation. While this model is supported by in vitro studies, direct in vivo evidence is lacking. Here, we use RT-qPCR and 3C-qPCR to study the transcriptional and architectural profiles of the H-NS (histone-like nucleoid structuring protein)-regulated, osmoresponsive proVWX operon of Escherichia coli at different osmolarities and provide in vivo evidence for transcription regulation by NAP-mediated chromosome re-modelling in bacteria. By consolidating our in vivo investigations with earlier in vitro and in silico studies that provide mechanistic details of how H-NS re-models DNA in response to osmolarity, we report that activation of proVWX in response to a hyperosmotic shock involves the destabilization of H-NS-mediated bridges anchored between the proVWX downstream and upstream regulatory elements (DRE and URE), and between the DRE and ygaY that lies immediately downstream of proVWX. The re-establishment of these bridges upon adaptation to hyperosmolarity represses the operon. Our results also reveal additional structural features associated with changes in proVWX transcript levels such as the decompaction of local chromatin upstream of the operon, highlighting that further complexity underlies the regulation of this model operon. H-NS and H-NS-like proteins are wide-spread amongst bacteria, suggesting that chromosome re-modelling may be a typical feature of transcriptional control in bacteria.",

    "text": "Deep mutational scanning studies suggest that synonymous mutations are typically silent and that most exposed, nonactive-site residues are tolerant to mutations. Here, we show that the ccdA antitoxin component of the Escherichia coli ccdAB toxin-antitoxin system is unusually sensitive to mutations when studied in the operonic context. A large fraction (∼80%) of single-codon mutations, including many synonymous mutations in the ccdA gene shows inactive phenotype, but they retain native-like binding affinity towards cognate toxin, CcdB. Therefore, the observed phenotypic effects are largely not due to alterations in protein structure/stability, consistent with a large region of CcdA being intrinsically disordered. E. coli codon preference and strength of ribosome-binding associated with translation of downstream ccdB gene are found to be major contributors of the observed ccdA mutant phenotypes. In select cases, proteomics studies reveal altered ratios of CcdA:CcdB protein levels in vivo, suggesting that the ccdA mutations likely alter relative translation efficiencies of the two genes in the operon. We extend these results by studying single-site synonymous mutations that lead to loss of function phenotypes in the relBE operon upon introduction of rarer codons. Thus, in their operonic context, genes are likely to be more sensitive to both synonymous and nonsynonymous point mutations than inferred previously.",

A total of 159 MDR-TB from China had their EMB MICs quantified, and the sequences of the four ethambutol resistance-associated regions were analyzed. A multivariate regression model was established to evaluate the effects of mutations on EMB resistance. Our results showed that overall 95.6% (109/114 isolates) of EMB-resistant isolates harbored at least one mutation within the regions associated with EMB resistance. Most mutations were in embB, particularly in the embB300-500, and the embC-embA intergenic regions. Mutations in other genes were seldom seen and mainly occurred along with mutations in the embB or the embC-embA among the EMB-resistant isolates. DNA sequencing of the embB300-500 and the embC-embA was the most effective approach for detecting EMB resistance, with an accuracy of 91.2%. Nevertheless, some EMB-susceptible isolates still had a single mutation in the gene related to EMB resistance. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between EMB high-level resistance and multiple mutations. Distinct individual mutations, as well as multiple concurrent mutations, within EMB resistance-associated genes, contributed to variable levels of EMB resistance. These results have broadened our understanding of the molecular characteristics of EMB resistance in China.",

    "text": "Hypoxanthine, prevalent in animals and plants, is used in the production of food additives, nucleoside antiviral drugs, and disease diagnosis. Current biological fermentation methods synthesize quantities insufficient to meet industrial demands. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a strain capable of industrial-scale production of hypoxanthine. De novo synthesis of hypoxanthine was achieved by blocking the hypoxanthine decomposition pathway, thus alleviating transcriptional repression and multiple feedback inhibition, and introducing a purine operon from Bacillus subtilis to construct a chassis strain. The effects of knocking out the IMP(Inosine 5'-monophosphate) branch on the growth status and titer of the strain were then investigated, and the effectiveness of adenosine deaminase and adenine deaminase was verified. Overexpressing these enzymes created a dual pathway for hypoxanthine synthesis, enhancing the metabolic flow of hypoxanthine synthesis and preventing auxotrophic strain formation. Introducing IMP-specific 5' -nucleotidase addressed the issue of adenylate accumulation. In addition, the metabolic flow of the guanine branch was dynamically regulated by the guaB gene. The supply of glutamine and aspartic acid precursors was enhanced by introducing an exogenous glnA mutant gene, overexpressing aspC, and replacing the weaker promoter to regulate the aspartic acid branching pathway. Ultimately, fermentation in a 5 L bioreactor for 48 h produced 30.6 g/L hypoxanthine, with a maximum real-time productivity of 1.4 g/L/h, the highest value of hypoxanthine production by microbial fermentation reported so far. The intracellular purine biosynthesis pathway is extensive and regulated at multiple levels in cells. The IMP branch in the hypoxanthine synthesis pathway has a higher metabolic flux. The current challenge lies in systematically allocating the metabolic flux within the branch pathway to achieve substantial product accumulation. In this study, E. coli was used as the chassis strain to construct a dual pathway for IMP and AMP(Adenosine 5'-monophosphate) synergistic hypoxanthine synthesis and dynamically regulate the guanine branch pathway.

Due to its small size (~20 μm), identification and quantification by molecular tools is preferable as an alternative to the laborious counting of specimen in quantitative protargol stains. However, previous sequencing of the 18S rDNA V9 region of B. planctonicum from Lake Zurich (Switzerland) and subsequent quantification by fluorescence in situ hybridization yielded significantly lower cell numbers than using morphotype counting. This raised the question of whether B. planctonicum shows a cryptic diversity or whether it is just a 'complex species' with intra-clonal polymorphisms. Over three years, we established numerous monoclonal cultures, and long-read sequencing of rDNA operons revealed four distinct dominant haplotypes (BpHs 1-4). The gene sequences of BpHs 1 and 3 differed by 6% and did not share intra-clonal polymorphisms, providing evidence for two distinct clades. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses corroborate the sister relationship between Balanion and Askenasia (plus Hexasterias and Radiosperma). Morphologically, the two Balanion clades are nearly indistinguishable with small differences in macronucleus size and in the cell length to width ratio. CARD-FISH analyses indicated that the diversity of B. planctonicum is even more extensive with still unidentified clades.",

Interrogation of sequence data from K. michiganensis strains in our collection has revealed the presence of multiple large plasmids encoding type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems. Such TA systems are responsible for mediating a range of phenotypes, including plasmid stability ('addiction') and antibiotic persistence. In this work, we characterize the hipBA TA locus found within the Klebsiella oxytoca species complex (KoSC). The HipBA TA system is encoded on a plasmid carried by K. michiganensis PS_Koxy4, isolated from an infection outbreak. Employing viability and plasmid stability assays, we demonstrate that PS_Koxy4 HipA is a potent antibacterial toxin and that HipBA is a functional TA module contributing substantially to plasmid maintenance. Further, we provide in silico data comparing HipBA modules across the entire KoSC. We provide the first evidence of the role of a plasmid-encoded HipBA system in stability of mobile genetic elements and analyse the presence of HipBA across the KoSC.

    "text": "We propose a hypothesis for the simultaneous emergence of bacteria, archaea, viruses, and mobile elements by sequential and concrete biochemical pathways. The emergence process can be considered analogous to crystallization, where genetic and biochemical systems stabilize as organisms evolve from their common ancestor, the LUCA, which was a non-free-living pool of single operon type genomes including double-stranded (ds) DNA at an ancient submarine alkaline vent. Each dsDNA operon was transcribed by different systems in σ, TFIIB, or TBP genomes. Double-stranded DNA operons can fuse and stabilize through the action of specific transcription systems, leading to differentiation between the Bacteria (σ genome) and Archaea (TBP genome) domains. Error catastrophe can be overcome by the parallel gain of DNA replication and DNA repair mechanisms in both genomes. Enlarged DNA enabled efficient local biochemical reactions. Both genomes independently recruited lipids to facilitate reactions by forming coacervates at the chamber of the vent. Bilayer lipid membrane formation, proto-cell formation with a permeable membrane, proto-cell division, and the evolution of membrane-associated biochemistry are presented in detail. Simultaneous crystallization of systems in non-free-living bacteria and non-free-living archaea triggered the co-crystallization of primitive viruses and mobile elements. An arms race between non-free-living cells and primitive viruses finally led to free-living cells with a cell wall and mature viruses.",

    "text": "Iron is an essential nutrient for microbial growth. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can survive under diverse conditions, including iron-depleted environments with the aid of small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs). P. aeruginosa also uses three quorum sensing (QS) systems: Las, Rhl and Pqs, to coordinate virulence and infection establishment at the population level. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of the sRNA Lrs1, the gene of which is positioned within the promoter of the Pqs biosynthetic operon pqsABCDE. Transcriptomics and phenotypic assays indicate that Lrs1 downregulates the production of the siderophore pyochelin but not pyoverdine, and that lrs1 regulation itself is dependent on iron availability. Although Lrs1 has been implicated in a positive feedback loop with the transcriptional regulator LasR in the strain PA14, the present findings indicate that this is not the case in PAO1-L in the tested conditions. Transcription of Lrs1 is dependent on quorum sensing, predominantly on RhlR with an auxiliary effect by PqsE. Furthermore, the Pqs system and phenazine production are modulated by Lrs1 only under iron limitation. This study identifies Lrs1 as a new QS-dependent post-transcriptional regulator in low iron, highlighting its importance in environmental adaptation in P. aeruginosa.",

The mutual influence of network signaling molecules represented by cells' natural metabolites, including indole and second messengers (p) ppGpp and cAMP, is hitherto not well understood, being the aim of this study. E. coli parent strain BW25141 ((p) ppGpp+) and deletion knockout BW25141ΔrelAΔspoT which is unable to synthesize (p)ppGpp ((p)ppGpp0) were cultivated in M9 medium supplemented with different glucose concentrations (5.6 and 22.2 mM) in the presence of tryptophan as a substrate for indole synthesis and in its absence. The glucose content was determined with the glucose oxidase method; the indole content, by means of HPLC; and the cAMP concentration, by ELISA. The onset of an increase in initially low intracellular cAMP content coincided with the depletion of glucose in the medium. Maximum cAMP accumulation in the cells was proportional to the concentration of initially added glucose. At the same time, the (p) ppGpp0 mutant showed a decrease in maximum cAMP levels compared to the (p)ppGpp+ parent, which was the most pronounced in the medium with 22.2 mM glucose. So, (p)ppGpp was able to positively regulate cAMP formation. The promoter of the tryptophanase operon responsible for indole biosynthesis is known to be under the positive control of catabolic repression. Therefore, in the cells of the (p)ppGpp+ strain grown in the tryptophan-free medium that were characterized by a low rate of spontaneous indole formation, its synthesis significantly increased in response to the rising cAMP level just after glucose depletion. However, this was not observed in the (p)ppGpp0 mutant cells with reduced cAMP accumulation. When tryptophan was added to the medium, both of these strains demonstrated high indole production, which was accompanied by a decrease in cAMP accumulation compared to the tryptophan-free control. Thus, under glucose depletion, (p)ppGpp can positively regulate the accumulation of both cAMP and indole, while the latter, in its turn, has a negative effect on cAMP formation.",

    "text": "Current rDNA reference sequence databases are tailored towards shorter DNA markers, such as parts of the 16/18S marker or the internally transcribed spacer (ITS) region. However, due to advances in long-read DNA sequencing technologies, longer stretches of the rDNA operon are increasingly used in environmental sequencing studies to increase the phylogenetic resolution. There is, therefore, a growing need for longer rDNA reference sequences. Here, we present the ribosomal operon database (ROD), which includes eukaryotic full-length rDNA operons fished from publicly available genome assemblies. Full-length operons were detected in 34.1% of the 34,701 examined eukaryotic genome assemblies from NCBI. In most cases (53.1%), more than one operon variant was detected, which can be due to intragenomic operon copy variability, allelic variation in non-haploid genomes, or technical errors from the sequencing and assembly process. The highest copy number found was 5947 in Zea mays. In total, 453,697 unique operons were detected, with 69,480 operon variant clusters remaining after intragenomic clustering at 99% sequence identity. The operon length varied extensively across eukaryotes, ranging from 4136 to 16,463 bp, which will lead to considerable polymerase chain reaction (PCR) bias during amplification of the entire operon. Clustering the full-length operons revealed that the different parts (i.e., 18S, 28S, and the hypervariable regions V4 and V9 of 18S) provide divergent taxonomic resolution, with 18S, the V4 and V9 regions being the most conserved.

    "text": "Human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae forms multiple epigenetically and phenotypically distinct intra-populations by invertase PsrA-driven inversions of DNA methyltransferase hsdS genes in the colony opacity-determinant (cod) locus. As manifested by phase switch between opaque and transparent colonies, different genome methylation patterns or epigenomes confer pathogenesis-associated traits, but it is unknown how the pathogen controls the hsdS inversion orientations. Here, we report our finding of the SpxA1-TenA toxin-antitoxin (TA) system that regulates the orientations of hsdS inversions, and thereby bacterial epigenome and associated traits (e.g., colony opacity) by targeting pneumococcal protein synthesis. SpxA1 and TenA were found to constitute a highly conserved type II TA system in S. pneumoniae, primarily based on the observation that overexpressing toxin TenA led to growth arrest in E. coli and enhanced autolysis in S. pneumoniae, and the antitoxin SpxA1 repressed the transcription of the spxA1-tenA operon. When the transcription of tenA was de-repressed by a spontaneous AT di-nucleotide insertion/deletion in the promoter region of the spxA1-tenA operon, TenA bound to the ribosome maturation factor RimM, and thereby reduced the cellular level of alternative sigma factor ComX (known for the activation of natural transformation-associated genes). Attenuation of ComX expression in turn enhanced the transcription of the invertase gene psrA, which favored the formation of the transparent colony phase-associated hsdS allelic configurations in the cod locus. Phenotypically, moderate expression of TenA dramatically reshaped pneumococcal epigenome and colony opacity. Because spontaneous variations frequently occur during bacterial growth in the number of the AT di-nucleotides in the promoter region of the spxA1-tenA operon, this locus acts as a programmed genetic switch that generates pneumococcal subpopulations with epigenetic and phenotypic diversity.",

The accumulation of stringent response effectors, (p)ppGpp, causes differential expression of approximately 500 genes, including genes of bacterial endogenous toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems. However, the exact link between (p)ppGpp and toxin-antitoxin systems' activation, as well as toxin-antitoxin role in stress adaptation remains disputed. In this study, we performed a complex analysis of changes (RNA-Seq) in the toxin-antitoxin operons' transcription in response to nitrogen, fatty acid, or carbon starvation, in bacteria with different abilities of (p)ppGpp accumulation.

    "text": "Escherichia coli (E. coli) has been one of the most studied model organisms in the history of life sciences. Initially thought just to be commensal bacteria, E. coli has shown wide phenotypic diversity including pathogenic isolates with great relevance to public health. Though pangenome analysis has been attempted several times, there is no systematic functional characterization of the E. coli subgroups according to the gene profile. Systematically scanning for optimal parametrization, we have built the E. coli pangenome from 1324 complete genomes. The pangenome size is estimated to be ~25,000 gene families (GFs). Whereas the core genome diminishes as more genomes are added, the softcore genome (≥95% of strains) is stable with ~3000 GFs regardless of the total number of genomes. Apparently, the softcore genome (with a 92% or 95% generation threshold) can define the genome of a bacterial species listing the critically relevant, evolutionarily most conserved or important classes of GFs. Unsupervised clustering of common E. coli sequence types using the presence/absence GF matrix reveals distinct characteristics of E. coli phylogroups B1, B2, and E. We highlight the bi-lineage nature of B1, the variation of the secretion and of the iron acquisition systems in ST11 (E), and the incorporation of a highly conserved prophage into the genome of ST131 (B2). The tail structure of the prophage is evolutionarily related to R2-pyocin (a tailocin) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. We hypothesize that this molecular machinery is highly likely to play an important role in protecting its own colonies; thus, contributing towards the rapid rise of pandemic E. coli ST131. This study has explored the optimized pangenome development in E. coli. We provide complete GF lists and the pangenome matrix as supplementary data for further studies. We identified biological characteristics of different E. coli subtypes, specifically for phylogroups B1, B2, and E. We found an operon-like genome region coding for a tailocin specific for ST131 strains. The latter is a potential killer weapon providing pandemic E. coli ST131 with an advantage in inter-bacterial competition and, suggestively, explains their dominance as human pathogen among E. coli strains.",

    "text": "The ability of bacteria to use natural carbon sources greatly affects their growth and survival in the environment. Bacteria have evolved versatile abilities to use environmental carbon sources, but their diversity and assimilation pathways remain largely unexplored. Trans-aconitic acid (TAA), a geometric isomer of cis-aconitic acid involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, has long been considered a natural carbon source metabolizable by bacteria. However, its catabolism and ecological role in linking bacterial interactions with the environment remain unclear. Here, we identify a regulatory system in Bacillus velezensis FZB42 that is capable of sensing and catabolizing TAA. The system consists of a tar operon, an adjacent positive regulatory gene tarR, and a shared promoter. After receiving the TAA signal, the TarR protein interacts directly with the promoter, initiating the expression of the membrane transporter TarB and aconitate isomerase TarA encoded by the operon, which function in importing the TAA and isomerizing it into the central intermediate cis-aconitic acid. Subsequent soil colonization experiments reveal that TAA assimilating ability can give its coding bacteria a growth and competitive advantage. Bioinformatics analyses coupled with bacterial isolation experiments further show that the assimilation system of TAA is widely distributed in the bacterial domain, and its assimilating bacteria are also extensively distributed in nature, indicating an important role of TAA metabolism in bacterial carbon acquisition. This work emphasizes the importance of metabolic adaptation to environmental carbon sources for bacterial survival and may provide inspiration for engineering microbes with enhanced environmental competitiveness.",

In this work, we analyze the transcriptional landscape associated with adaptation in an emerging zoonotic pathogen, Bordetella hinzii, as it evolved during a 45-month infection in an IL12Rβ1-deficient immunocompromised host. We find evidence of multiple niche-specific modifications in the intravascular and gastrointestinal compartments, involving the superoxide dismutase system, glutamate and ectoine metabolism, chaperone-mediated protein folding, pilus organization, and peptide transport. Individual blood lineages displayed modifications in glutathione, phenylacetate, and 3-phenylpropionate metabolism, iron cluster assembly, and electron transport, whereas individual gastrointestinal lineages demonstrated changes relating to gluconeogenesis, de novo pyrimidine synthesis, and transport of peptides and phosphate ions. Down regulation of the flagellar operon with corresponding loss of flagellar structures occurred in multiple lineages, suggesting an evolutionary tradeoff between motility and host immune evasion. Finally, methylome analysis demonstrates alteration of global genome methylation associated with loss of a Type III methyltransferase. Our findings reveal striking plasticity in how pathogen transcriptomes explore functional space as they evolve in the context of host infection, and demonstrate that such analysis may uncover phenotypic adaptations not apparent from genomic analysis alone.",

    "text": "The silent E. coli fucAO operon can be activated by IS5 insertion upstream of its regulatory region, allowing cellular growth on L-1,2-propanediol. Little information is available concerning the transcriptional mechanism behind IS5-mediated fucAO activation. In this study, we demonstrate the formation of a unique \"fusion\" promoter (Pfsn) following IS5 insertion, which drives expression of the downstream fucAO operon. Our findings indicate that this functional σ70 fusion promoter is generated using a DNA sequence carrying a Crp-binding site directly upstream of the IS5 element, followed by the otherwise inactive IS5 transposase promoter. Under non-inducing conditions, this fusion promoter contributes to full operon expression while the native operon promoter PfucAO remains silent. As a typical Class I promoter, Pfsn is independent of the fuc regulon activator FucR, but its activity is exclusively reliant on the binding of Crp-cAMP to the upstream Crp-binding site. Under inducing conditions, the presence of functional FucR can further elevate fucAO operon expression by activating the native operon promoter, PfucAO. In the latter case, Pfsn and PfucAO function independently, and contribute to operon expression to nearly the same extent. Thus, we have discovered a novel IS-dependent fusion expression system that is modulated by a transcriptional factor in bacteria.",

This groundbreaking technology holds immense potential for the development of targeted therapies for a wide range of diseases, including cancers, genetic disorders, and hereditary diseases. CRISPR-Cas9 based genome editing is a multi-step process such as designing a precise gRNA, selecting the appropriate Cas protein, and thoroughly evaluating both on-target and off-target activity of the Cas9-gRNA complex. To ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of CRISPR-Cas9 system, after the targeted DNA cleavage, the process requires careful analysis of the resultant outcomes such as indels and deletions. Following the success of artificial intelligence (AI) in various fields, researchers are now leveraging AI algorithms to catalyze and optimize the multi-step process of CRISPR-Cas9 system. To achieve this goal AI-driven applications are being integrated into each step, but existing AI predictors have limited performance and many steps still rely on expensive and time-consuming wet-lab experiments. The primary reason behind low performance of AI predictors is the gap between CRISPR and AI fields. Effective integration of AI into multi-step CRISPR-Cas9 system demands comprehensive knowledge of both domains. This paper bridges the knowledge gap between AI and CRISPR-Cas9 research. It offers a unique platform for AI researchers to grasp deep understanding of the biological foundations behind each step in the CRISPR-Cas9 multi-step process. Furthermore, it provides details of 80 available CRISPR-Cas9 system-related datasets that can be utilized to develop AI-driven applications. Within the landscape of AI predictors in CRISPR-Cas9 multi-step process, it provides insights of representation learning methods, machine and deep learning methods trends, and performance values of existing 50 predictive pipelines. In the context of representation learning methods and classifiers/regressors, a thorough analysis of existing predictive pipelines is utilized for recommendations to develop more robust and precise predictive pipelines.",

ABU isolates exhibiting activity against five or more UPEC strains were further characterized (PUTS 37, PUTS 58, PUTS 59, S-07-4, and SK-106-1). The inhibition of the CFS by proteinase K suggested that the antimicrobial activity was proteinaceous in nature, potentially bacteriocins. The activity of E. coli PUTS 58 and SK-106-1 was enhanced in an artificial urine medium, with both inhibiting all eight UPECs.

    "text": "The Enterococcus faecalis genome contains two enoyl-ACP reductases genes, fabK and fabI, which encode proteins having very different structures. Enoyl-ACP reductase catalyzes the last step of the elongation cycle of type II fatty acid synthesis pathway. The fabK gene is located within the large fatty acid synthesis operon whereas fabI is located together with two genes fabN and fabO required for unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. Prior work showed that FabK is weakly expressed due to poor translational initiation and hence virtually all the cellular enoyl ACP reductase activity is that encoded by fabI. Since FabK is a fully functional enzyme, the question is why FabI is an essential enzyme. Why not increase FabK activity? We report that overproduction of FabK is lethal whereas FabI overproduction only slows the growth and is not lethal. In both cases, normal growth is restored by the addition of oleic acid, an unsaturated fatty acid, to the medium indicating that enoyl ACP reductase overproduction disrupts unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. We report that this is due to competition with FabO, a putative 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I via FabN, a dehydratase/isomerase providing evidence that the enoyl-ACP reductase must be matched to the unsaturated fatty acid synthetic genes. FabO has been ascribed the same activity as E. coli FabB and we report in vitro evidence that this is the case, whereas FabN is a dehydratase/isomerase, having the activity of E. coli FabA. However, FabN is much larger than FabA, it is a hexamer rather than a dimer like FabA.",

    "text": "Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 is an oleaginous bacterium that has attracted considerable attention due to its capacity to use different carbon sources to accumulate significant levels of triacylglycerols that might be converted into biofuels. However, this strain cannot transform xylose into lipids reducing its potential when growing on saccharified lignocellulosic biomass. In this work, we demonstrate that wild type R. jostii RHA1 can be evolved by adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) to metabolize xylose without engineering heterologous metabolic pathways in the host. We have generated a phenotypically adapted ALE-xyl strain able to use xylose as the sole carbon and energy source more efficiently that an engineered recombinant strain harbouring heterologous xylA and xylB genes encoding a xylose isomerase metabolic pathway. The R. jostii RHA1 ALE-xyl strain accumulates lipids very efficiently using xylose as substrate, but even more importantly it can consume glucose and xylose at the same time. Transcriptomic analyses of ALE-xyl strain growing with glucose or xylose revealed the existence of a silent pentose metabolizing operon that is overexpressed in the presence of xylose. The detection of a xylose reductase activity together with the presence of xylitol in the cytoplasm of ALE-xyl strain suggests that xylose is consumed by a reductase pathway. This study demonstrates that, in cases where a clear phenotypic selection method is available, ALE can be used to improve very efficiently industrial microbial strains without using genetic engineering tools. Strategies focused to exploit the silent phenotypic flexibility of microorganisms to metabolize different carbon sources are powerful tools for the production of microbial value-added products using saccharified lignocellulosic wastes.",

    "text": "Lanthipeptides are a rapidly expanding family of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified natural compounds with diverse biological functions. Lanthipeptide structural and biosynthetic genes can readily be identified in genomic datasets, which provides a substantial repository for unique peptides with a wide range of potentially novel bioactivities. To realize this potential efficiently optimized heterologous production systems are required. However, only a few class I lanthipeptides have been successfully expressed using Escherichia coli as heterologous producer. This may be attributed to difficulties experienced in the co-expression of structural genes and multiple processing genes as well as complex optimization experiments. Here, an optimized modular plasmid system is presented for the complete biosynthesis for each of the class I lanthipeptides nisin and clausin, in E. coli. Genes encoding precursor lanthipeptides were fused to the gene encoding the mCherry red fluorescent protein and co-expressed along with the required synthetases from the respective operons. Antimicrobially active nisin and clausin were proteolytically liberated from the expressed mCherry fusions. The mCherry-NisA expression system combined with in vivo fluorescence monitoring was used to elucidate the effect of culture media composition, promoter arrangement, and culture conditions including choice of growth media and inducer agents on the heterologous expression of the class I lanthipeptides. To evaluate the promiscuity of the clausin biosynthetic enzymes, the optimized clausin expression system was used for the heterologous expression of epidermin. We succeeded in developing novel mCherry-fusion based plug and play heterologous expression systems to produce two different subgroups of class I lanthipeptides. Fully modified Pre-NisA, Pre-ClausA and Pre-EpiA fused to the mCherry fluorescence gene was purified from the Gram-negative host E. coli BL21 (DE3). Our study demonstrates the potential of using in vivo fluorescence as a platform to evaluate the expression of mCherry-fused lanthipeptides in E. coli. This allowed a substantial reduction in optimization time, since expression could be monitored in real-time, without the need for extensive and laborious purification steps or the use of in vitro activity assays. The optimized heterologous expression systems developed in this study may be employed in future studies for the scalable expression of novel NisA derivatives, or novel genome mined derivatives of ClausA and other class I lanthipeptides in E. coli.",

Examining patterns of chromosomal replication in the rnhAB mutants after UV could identify the problem sites. We show that normal rnhA (B) mutant replication initiates at three distinct oriK areas in the origin macrodomain, none of them coinciding with oriC proper, the dominant origin being some 400 kb away. Interestingly, initiation after UV switches to the DnaA-dependent oriK closest to oriC and continues from there until the growth replication pattern is restored, like in the rnhA single mutants. However, in the rnhAB double mutant, post-UV forks initiated at the new origin have difficulty reaching the terminus, with the major stalling sites at the rrn operons. In the rnhAB recBC mutants, additionally deficient in linear DNA degradation/repair, post-UV replication forks cannot traverse the origin-distal ribosomal RNA operons, rrnG and rrnH, showing that restoration of disintegrated replication forks is essential for replication in the rnhAB mutant. In contrast, the rnhAB rpoB* mutant, in which transcription complexes are unstable, is UV-resistant and resumes normal replication even faster than WT cells, indicating that the rnhAB mutants suffer from UV-induced replication-transcription conflicts.",

Forty uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) isolated from dogs (n = 30) and cats (n = 10) in Italy were analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of virulence factors and their classification into phylogenetic groups. The same strains were characterized by repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP)- and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR techniques. We found a high number of virulence factors such as fimbriae A, S fimbriae (sfa) and cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (cnf1) significantly associated with phylogenetic group B2. We demonstrated a high correlation between α-hemolysin A and pyelonephritis C, sfa, and cnf1 operons, confirming the presence of pathogenicity islands in these strains. In addition, UPEC belonging to group B2 harboured a greater number of virulence factors than strains from phylogenetic groups A, B1, and D. REP- and ERIC-PCR grouped the UPEC isolates into two major clusters, the former grouping E. coli strains belonging to phylogenetic group B2 and D, the latter grouping those belonging to groups A and B1. Given the significant genetic variability among the UPEC strains found in our study, it can be hypothesized that no specific genotype is responsible for cystitis in cats or dogs.",

Targeting of reporter genes revealed extended interference in P. oleovorans and Escherichia coli cells producing recombinant CRISPR ribonucleoprotein (crRNP) complexes. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses of Type IV-A1 CRISPRi-induced transcriptome alterations demonstrated highly effective long-range downregulation of histidine operon expression, whereas CRISPRi effects of dCas9 remained limited to the vicinity of its binding site. Single-molecule microscopy uncovered the localization dynamics of crRNP complexes. The tracks of fluorescently labeled crRNPs co-localized with regions of increased plasmid replication, supporting efficient plasmid targeting.

In response, MGEs have developed strategies to resist CRISPR-Cas, including the use of anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins.

Although ten families of helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif containing Aca proteins have been identified (Aca1-10), only three have been tested and shown to be transcriptional repressors of acr-aca expression. The AcrIIA1 protein (a Cas9 inhibitor) also contains a functionally similar HTH containing repressor domain. Here, we identified and analysed Aca and AcrIIA1 homologs across all bacterial genomes. Using HMM models we found aca-like genes are widely distributed in bacteria, both with and without known acr genes. The putative promoter regions of acr-aca operons were analysed and members of each family of bacterial Aca tested for regulatory function. For each Aca family, we predicted a conserved inverted repeat binding site within a core promoter. Promoters containing these sites directed reporter expression in E. coli and were repressed by the cognate Aca protein.

    "text": "This study aimed to probe if xylooligosaccharide (XOS) could act as an antimetabolite to impact the cell cycle and antibiotic tolerance of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC). We firstly measured the bacteriostasis of XOS against APEC O78 and its effect on the growth of APEC O78 growing on different medium. Afterwards, the effects of XOS on xylose operon activation along with the cell cycle and antibiotic tolerance of APEC O78 were analyzed. The results showed that XOS caused no inhibitory circle against APEC O78 and did not affect (P > 0.05) the growth of APEC O78 growing on LB medium. Besides, APEC O78 was unable to grow on M9 medium (carbon-free) added with XOS. However, XOS exerted a similar role as xylose in increasing (P < 0.05) the expression of certain xylose operon genes including xylose isomerase (XylA)-encoding gene (xylA) and xylose-binding periplasmic protein (XylF)-encoding gene (xylF) in APEC O78. The molecular docking simulation revealed that the major monomer components (xylobiose, xylotriose and xylotetraose) of XOS had stable binding potentials to both XylA and XylF proteins of E. coli, as supported by the low binding free energy and the formation of considerable hydrogen bonds between them. The subsequent analysis showed that XOS altered certain cell cycle-related genes expression, especially elevated (P < 0.05) nrdB expression and decreased ihfB expression to a degree. Moreover, XOS played a similar role as 2-deoxy-glucose (a glucose analogue serving as a typical antimetabolite) in lowering (P < 0.05) the number of ampicillin-tolerant APEC O78. Collectively, XOS had no direct bacteriostasis against APEC and could not be metabolized/utilized by APEC O78. However, it might become an analogue of xylose and then activate xylose transport- and metabolism-related proteins in APEC O78, thus functioning as a potential antimetabolite and exerting antimetabolic actions. This could at least partially interpret the observed roles of XOS in interfering with the cell cycle and diminishing the antibiotic tolerance of APEC O78. The above findings expand the knowledges about the functions of XOS and provide a basis for exploring novel strategies to reduce the antibiotic tolerance of APEC.",
