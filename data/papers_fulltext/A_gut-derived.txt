Although probiotics that produce bacteriocins with antimicrobial activity against specific microbial pathogens are a potential alternative to antibiotics, narrow-spectrum antimicrobials are especially desirable, as broad-spectrum antimicrobials may negatively impact the gut microbiome (

In conclusion, numerous studies have used nisin as a means of targeting disease-associated taxa (

Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from

Phylogenetic relatedness between nisin variants was inferred by aligning amino acid sequences using msaClustalW in the msa R package (v 1.30.1; BLOSUM matrix, gap opening penalty = 10, gap extension penalty = 0.2) (

The fecal slurry was prepared using a previous methodology (

A fecal slurry aliquot was defrosted before use and prepared at 10% concentration in fecal fermentation medium (

gDNA was extracted from 1 mL aliquots using the QIAmp PowerFecal ProDNA kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). Briefly, the centrifuged samples (4,000 rpm, 10 min) were resuspended in lysis buffer, and extractions were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was quantified using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, USA), and the purity was checked using the NanoDrop 1000 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Ireland).

The abundance of

DNA was prepared according to the Nextera XT DNA library preparation guide from Illumina and sequenced using 2 × 150 bp paired-end kit on the Illumina NextSeq Platform (Teagasc, Moorepark Sequencing Facility), with base-calling using bcl-convert (v3.8.4). Raw sequencing reads were processed through Trim Galore (v.0.6.1), with adapter and quality trimming performed using Cutadapt (v.2.6) and Fastqc (v.0.11.8), respectively, using default parameters and a Phred score cut-off of 20. Next, human host reads were filtered out by alignment to the human genome (

Taxonomic classification was performed using MetaPhlAn4 (v.4.0, database vJan21_CHOCOPhlAnSGB_202103). Functional profiling was performed on interleaved files (bbmap.v.38.22) using HUMAnN.v.3.6, using the taxonomic profiles from MetaPhlAn4 output with Bowtie2 (v.2.4) and DIAMOND (v.2.0.15). Both bacterial and archaeal reads were considered, with bacteria accounting for >99% of assigned reads in all samples. Additional functional profiling was performed using SUPER-FOCUS (v 0.34).

Significant differences between groups were established using a paired

Analysis was performed in the R statistical programming environment (v 4.2.2) and visualized using ggplot2 (

Dissimilarity matrices of taxonomic profiles were generated for Bray-Curtis and robust Aitchison distance (vegan), as well as weighted and unweighted UNIFRAC distance (phyloseq). These were compared using PERMANOVA (implemented via vegan::adonis2), analysis of similarity (ANOSIM; vegan::anosim), and beta dispersion (vegan::betadisper). Ordination of dissimilarity matrices for Bray-Curtis and robust Aitchison distance was performed using PCoA (vegan), while UNIFRAC distances underwent ordination with non-metric multidimensional scaling (phyloseq), with the exception of weighted UNIFRAC distances at T_24 where low stress was observed (9.9e-0.5), and hence, PCoA was applied (phyloseq).

Dissimilarity matrices were generated for functional profiles using robust Aitchison distance (vegan) and assessed as described above for taxonomic profiles (PERMANOVA, ANOSIM, and beta dispersion). Contributional alpha diversity was computed on HUMAnN4 taxonomy-stratified pathway abundance, using the FuncDiv package (v 1.0.0) (
