Biomanufacturing microbial surfactants usually requires aerobic processes. However, maintaining high dissolved oxygen levels necessitates high aeration and stirring rates, which often promote strong foaming [

In this study, proteome analysis was performed for detecting the adaption of

As standard cultivation method in shake flask, cultures were grown using a flask filling volume of 10% at 30 °C with an agitation speed of 120 rpm. For analysis of the fluorescent biosensor signals to decreased oxygen availability in shake flask, agitation was decreased from 120 rpm to 40 rpm, when OD

For all experiments, the following seed train was used: 10 mL of LB medium (10 g/L peptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 5 g/L NaCl) was inoculated with 10 µL of a glycerol stock of a selected strain. The pre-culture was cultivated for 24 h before being used for inoculation in SupM medium [

Similar to the study of Hoffmann et al. [

A sample of 5 mL was taken from the shake flask and centrifuged for 5 min at 30 °C and 4.700 x

Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20.000 x

NanoLC-MS/MS experiments were performed on an Ultimate 3000 nano-RSLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) coupled to an Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a Nanospray-Flex ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were concentrated and desalted on a trap column (µPAC Trapping column nano, PharmaFluidics, Belgium) and separated on a 50 cm µPAC nanoLC column (PharmaFluidics, Belgium) operated at constant temperature of 40 °C. Peptides were separated using a gradient with the following profile: 2% (700 nL/min) − 8% (300 nL/min) solvent B in 3 min, 8 − 20% (300 nL/min) solvent B in 27 min, 20 − 35% (300 nL/min) solvent B in 8 min, 35 − 95% (300 nL/min) solvent B in 3 min, isocratic 95% (300 nL/min) solvent B for 3 min, 95% (300 nL/min) − 2% (700 nL/min) solvent B in 5 minutes and isocratic 2% (700 nL/min) solvent B for 10 min. The solvents used were 0.1% FA (solvent A) and 0.1% FA in ACN/H

MaxQuant output file (protein groups table) was loaded into Perseus version 1.6.14.0 [

For determination of the cell length during different agitation speed in shake flasks, a volume of 10 µL bacterial culture was taken during the mid-growth phases and distributed on a glass slide. After air-drying for 2 min, bacteria were heat-fixed using a Bunsen burner, and 20 µL of 0.9% (w/v) NaCl solution were dropped on the sample prior to applying a cover slip. Cells were examined with a Zeiss Leica DM 2000 LED (Oberkochen, Germany) in phase contrast 3 with a 100x objective and photographs were taken with the Leica MC 170 HD (Wetzlar, Germany). Cell lengths were measured using ImageJ (version 1.54).

Isolation of plasmid DNA and chromosomal DNA were done with innuPREP Plasmid Mini Kit 2.0 and innuPREP Bacteria DNA Kit, respectively (IST Innuscreen GmbH, Berlin, Germany), according to the manufacturer´s protocol. Primers were obtained from Eurofins (Ebersberg, Germany) and Thermo Fisher (Sindelfingen, Germany). For polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), Q5 high-fidelity polymerase and Taq-polymerase were used. All PCR kits were obtained from New England Biolabs (Frankfurt a. M., Germany). PCRs were conducted according to standard protocols of the manufacturer. Purification of PCR-based cloning DNA fragments was performed with the Monarch

A pre-culture grown in LB medium was used to inoculate SupM-medium as a second pre-culture. Subsequently, exponentially growing cells were used for inoculation of the main cultures in ModR medium at an optical density (OD

The following bioreactor systems were used for different bioprocesses: For batch cultivations of the fluorescent biosensor strains, a 2 L bioreactor system (Labfors 4, Infors HT, Bottmingen, Switzerland) with 1 L working volume was used. For batch cultivation of the di-rhamnolipid producing strain, a 10 L bioreactor system (BIOSTAT

Fluorescence was measured using the FLUOstar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany). Therefore, 100 µL of a sample was pipetted per well into a flat bottom 96-well plate (TPP, Trasadingen, Switzerland) in technical triplicates. Fluorescence and OD

Samples for untargeted proteome analysis were taken after 10, 30 and 60 min of oxygen reduction and were compared to reference cultures grown under continuous agitation without atmosphere exchange. In proteome analysis, only proteins were considered that appeared significantly (

In a next step, the oxygen level-induced rhamnolipid production was successfully applied to establish an autonomously inducing rhamnolipid bioproduction process (Fig.

By coupling the rhamnolipid production to the prevailing oxygen level, the process could be sharply divided into a growth phase without quantitative rhamnolipid production and a production phase with very low growth rates, but relatively high biomass-specific product yield of up to Y

Foam formation often is a main obstacle for efficient production of biosurfactants such as rhamnolipids. Microaerobic fermentation is a promising but underexplored strategy for bioprocess control, as low aeration and stirring rates can effectively reduce foam formation in bioreactors. In addition, low oxygen availability leads to microbial adaptation, which can be used to induce biosynthetic genes. The robust model bacterium
