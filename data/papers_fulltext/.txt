A stunningly rich microbial community is vastly prevalent in most natural environments. Scarcity of resources and push for space are some of the essential determinants that shape the bacterial ecosystem. Bacteria have evolved an arsenal of tools to thwart potential contenders from colonization. Potent tool-box systems that bacteria exploit may either harm, kill or inhibit menacing competitors [

Nutrient deprivation in a growing population and genotoxic environmental stresses are some of the factors that are predicated to influence the evolution of a diverse arsenal of weaponry among bacterial communities, which directly modulates a broad spectrum of microbes [

The translational machinery is one of the most popular targets for both toxins acting on neighboring cells, as well as intracellular toxins from toxin–antitoxin pairs. RelE cleaves mRNA in A-site [

The most common catalytic active site among various RNA-targeting effectors is the RNase domain. Several substrates are generated by various mechanisms that are executed mainly by the metal-dependent and independent RNAse activity. The former generates two substrates with a 2′,3′-cyclic-PO4 on the 3′ end of the 5′ fragment and a 5′-OH at the 5′ terminus of the 3′ fragment via a transesterification reaction. The latter yields a 5′-PO4 on the 5′ end of the 3′ fragment and a 3′-OH at the 3′ end of 5′ fragment. In addition, other RNases, such as RloC further exert an exonucleolytic cleavage on the digested products, even though most of the RNA-targeting effectors exert endonuclease activity [

In order to catalyze ligation activity, classical RNA ligases join 5′-PO4 and 3′-OH termini in an ATP/Mg(II) dependent fashion. On the contrary, an atypical RNA ligase that includes RtcB mends a 2′,3′-cyclic-PO4 and 5′-OH RNA cleaved substrates, whose catalysis is GTP/Mn(II) dependent [

Upon cleavage by specific RNA-targeting effectors such as MazF, generated substrates that are specific to RtcB, 2′,3′-cyclic-PO4 and a 5′-OH, can be healed and sealed to retain functionality [

Apart from the expected primer extension stop at the 16S rRNA nucleotide G1494 upon colicin E3 treatment, we occasionally observe additional reverse transcriptase stops, such as, at the nucleotide C1496 in the

A plethora of toxins are known to cleave several components in the cell which are essential for cell viability. Having shown the potential substrate of the RtcB-PrfH module for protection from colicin E3 activity towards the 16S rRNA, we decided to check and determine whether this module aids in protection against the cleavage of tRNAs by the corresponding toxins in vivo. In order to demonstrate this, we used

Colicin E5 and D produce 2′,3′ cyclophosphate and 5′-OH RNA ends, similar to colicin E3, and one would expect a protective action from the RtcB2-PrfH module for these colicins [

In a diverse pool of bacterial communities, some of the well characterized and sporadically spread proteins with a strong similarity to bacterial release factors include ArfB and PrfH. Structurally, these two peculiar proteins retain a highly conserved GGQ motif. The ArfB protein has an extended C-terminal α-helical region which is essential for recognizing and scanning ribosomes that are jammed on non-stop complexes [

Single and double knockout genotypes of

We then asked whether complementation by single or both

The results from the primer extension analysis speak in favor of the possibility that, after the initial colicin E3-mediated 16S rRNA cleavage, an additional degradation of the rRNA may follow. Thus, a pathway of rRNA damage and repair might seem more complex than is currently understood.

There is an existing bonafide

Taken together, our results demonstrate a synergistic effect of the counter-conflict system, RtcB2-PrfH module, on its ability to potentiate a protective effect on damaged ribosomes by colicin E3. This preliminary study enables further perspectives in understanding this kind of defense system. Given the diversity of RNases acting upon the translation machinery, one could expect the existence of several corresponding defense armaments.

Total RNA was purified using the TRIzol™ Reagent, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Briefly, the untreated and treated cells were pelleted, followed by the complete removal of LB. The cell pellet was resuspended in TRIzol™ reagent in order to allow the complete dissociation of nucleoprotein complexes. Chloroform (0.2 mL) was used for cell lysis and the samples were further incubated for 2 min at room temperature. Centrifugation of the samples was then performed for 15 min at 12,000×

The isolated RNA (~500 ng) was used to run a pre-phoresed 20% denaturing polyacrylamide UREA gel electrophoresis. Firstly, the samples were aliquoted into PCR strips, followed by the addition of FA loading buffer. The samples were mixed, spun-down and heated at 95 °C for 4 min. A volume of 5 µL was loaded onto the prepared gel and ran under 1X TBE buffer. The gel was then stained with SYBR™ Green II RNA Gel Stain (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 40 min while shaking under complete darkness. The gels were then scanned and visualized using the Image Lab software (Bio-Rad).

For a total volume of 20 µL, the following contents were added to the mixture: 4 µL of reverse primer (CCTACGGTTACCTTGTT) with an initial concentration of 20 µM; 2 µL of 10X reaction Buffer A (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA); 2 µL of labeled γ-[32P] ATP; 10.2 µL of Milli-Q ultrapure water; and 1.8 µL of T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The samples were then mixed, spun down and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by storage at −20 °C.

The PCR product of 16S rRNA was amplified using pAM522 plasmid as a template with appropriate primers that would enable detection of the cleavage signal zone for the preparation of the sequencing reactions. The following protocol was utilized for PCR amplification using a Q5

For the sequencing reactions, 4 µL of ddGTP, ddATP, ddTTP and ddCTP provided by the manufacturer were placed into separate PCR tubes (ThermoFisher Scientific, Vilnius, Lithuania). All the preparatory reactions were performed under ice conditions. A mastermix with 1 µL template DNA (PCR product); 11.5 µL Milli-Q ultrapure water; 2 µL of reaction buffer; 1 µL of labeled primer; and 2 µL of DNA polymerase were added, mixed, spun-down and aliquoted (4 µL) in to the PCR tubes with ddNTPs. The samples were spun down briefly, followed by the addition of 4 µL of mineral oil. Upon spinning down the samples, the reactions were then placed in a thermocycler at 95 °C-2 min, 95 °C-30 s, 55 °C-30 s and 72 °C-1 min for 40 cycles, followed by a final extension at 72 °C-2 min and storage at 4 °C. A stop solution (8 µL) was then added to the sequencing reactions and stored at −20 °C until needed.

A concentration of ~500 ng RNA was used as a template for the primer extension. First, annealing of the primer to the RNA was performed using the following cocktail (for 1 reaction): 500 ng of RNA (2.5 µL); 0.25 µL of 2 µM labeled primer; 0.25 µL of 10 µM dNTPs; and 4.25 µL of MilliQ ultrapure water. A non-template sample (MilliQ ultrapure water) was added as a negative control of the experiment. The samples were mixed, spun down and incubated at 85 °C for 1 min, followed by a 1 °C temperature drop to 26 °C over a 30 min window. The samples were then placed on ice for 2 min.

The first stage for the preparation of the qRT-PCR was the removal of genomic DNA from 1 μg total RNA that was purified using the DNase I, RNase-free kit in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Briefly, the cocktail for a single reaction included: RNA (1 μg); 10X reaction buffer (1 μL); DNase I, RNase-free (1 μL (1U)); and DEPC-treated water (added to 10 μL). The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. In order to prevent RNA degradation, a volume of 1 µL of 50 mM EDTA chelating agent was then added to the mixture with a further incubation at 65 °C for 10 min. The prepared RNA was used as a template for cDNA synthesis using the Maxima First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit for qRT-PCR (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The components for reverse transcription for a single reaction included: 5X Reaction Mix (4 µL), Maxima Enzyme Mix (2 µL), template RNA (2.5 μL), and nuclease-free water added to 20 µL. The samples were then incubated for 10 min at 25 °C which was then followed by a further incubation window of 15 min at 50 °C. The reaction was terminated by heating at 85 °C for 5 min. The generated cDNA that was synthesized was used as a template for the qRT-PCR, wherein the Maxima SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (2X) kit was utilized for the analysis (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
