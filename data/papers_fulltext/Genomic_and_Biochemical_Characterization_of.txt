BSH activity was qualitatively determined by plate assay. Fresh bacterial cultures were dropped onto TPY agar containing 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5% (

This tolerance implied the ability to survive simulated saliva (SS), simulated gastric fluid (SGF), and simulated intestinal fluid (SIF). SS consisted of a sterilized solution of pH 6.2 of phosphate buffer (PBS) and 0.01% (

The DPPH assay of the strains was analyzed by mixing one milliliter of freshly prepared DPPH solution (0.2 mmol/L in methanol) with 1 mL of sample solution. Then, the mixture was allowed to react for 30 min in the dark. The absorbance was measured with a UV-visible spectrophotometer at 517 nm. The assay was performed by three independent experiments. The DPPH scavenging ability was calculated using the formula:

In the case of pantothenate, the gene was found codifying to ketol-acid reductoisomerase (EC 1.1.1.86), acetolactate synthase I/III (EC 2.2.1.6), pantetheine-phosphate adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.3), dihydroxy-acid dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.9), holo-[acyl-carrier protein] synthase (EC 2.7.8.7), dephospho-CoA kinase (EC 2.7.1.24), 2-dehydropantoate 2-reductase (EC 1.1.1.169), phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.36), phosphopantothenate-cysteine ligase (EC 6.3.2.5), type III pantothenate kinase (EC 2.7.1.33), and branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.42).

Although

Another important biosynthetic capability in the genome was secondary bile acid biosynthesis by choloylglycine hydrolase (EC 3.5.1.24), an enzyme with possible applications in hypercholesterolemia. Some probiotics show hypocholesterolemic effects in animal models due to reductions in lipid and cholesterol levels since BSH can deconjugate bile salts, inducing a de novo synthesis of conjugated salts at the expense of cholesterol, resulting in decreasing serum levels, alterations in energy, homeostasis and the excretion of larger amounts of free bile acids in feces, thus making BSH a clinically significant enzyme [

Probiotics have some proposed mechanisms in the elimination of cholesterol, such as the assimilation of cholesterol by growing cells, the binding of cholesterol to the cellular surface, the incorporation of cholesterol into the cellular membrane, the production of short-chain fatty acids by oligosaccharides, the deconjugation of bile via BSH, and the coprecipitation of cholesterol with deconjugated bile [

Several Bifidobacteria are resistant to β-lactam antibiotics, as reported previously [

Regarding hemolysis,

The tolerance to sequential simulated gastrointestinal solutions showed

Whether Bifidobacteria colonize from birth or are ingested as a probiotic, they will encounter and must overcome stresses in the GIT with bile being the major stress-inducing factor to bacteria, due to its bactericidal properties. Different mechanisms of bile resistance by Bifidobacteria have been set, including the efflux of bile salts by multi-drug transporters, compositional changes of the cell membrane, F

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced by aerobic respiration and the immune defense of organisms. Excessive amounts of ROS can result in cellular damage, which promotes chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. Certain probiotic strains present significant antioxidant effects and can act as antioxidants to maintain intestinal redox balance in the gut by adhering to and colonizing the intestinal lumen [

The antioxidative potential of Bifidobacteria has been previously reported using the DPPH free radical scavenging method. We reported that intact cells and cell-free extracts of

The adhesion of probiotics to human GIT Is considered one of the main criteria for the bacteria to benefit health. The adhesion ability of probiotics is dependent and is influenced by physicochemical and biological conditions. It depends on environmental factors, such as pH and temperature, the ionic strength of the medium, as well as characteristics of both the bacteria and substrate, such as surface free energy, the presence of bacterial surface structures, such as specific attachment proteins, and their hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity.
