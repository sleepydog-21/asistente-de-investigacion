Blood was collected from 344 dogs (111 pet dogs, 122 pound dogs and 111 hunting dogs) during 2003–2005 in the Province of Palermo, Sicily, Italy, for these studies. Blood was collected into sterile tubes with anticoagulant (EDTA), held at 4°C until arrival at the laboratory and then stored at -20°C for DNA extraction.

DNA was extracted from blood and tick samples using the GenElute Mammalian Genomic DNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The
