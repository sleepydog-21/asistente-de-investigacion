Strains were streaked onto Luria–Bertani (LB) plates supplemented with required antibiotics for each strain. For the WT, we used 100 μg/ml ampicillin; for Δ5 and Δ6, we used 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 40 μg/ml spectinomycin, respectively; and for Δ7, we used 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 40 μg/ml spectinomycin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Single colonies were inoculated into LB and grown at 37°C and 220 rpm for a pre-culture of 2 h, then diluted 1/250 into M9Glu medium (1× M9 medium supplemented with CaCl

A histogram of the apparent diffusion coefficient, D*, was compiled for each dataset by computing the mean squared displacement (MSD) of individual trajectories using at least four single-step distances. Histograms of the apparent diffusion coefficient were fitted with two-gamma distributions, with the value for the immobile species fixed at a value measured using an experimental control [0.08–0.10 μm

Clustering analysis of RNAP molecules localized by rapidSTORM was done using a MATLAB implementation of the DBSCAN algorithm [see (

While the DBSCAN algorithm identifies individual clusters present in a cell, we also require a global picture of clustering for each dataset that is also ideally independent of input parameters. For a parameter-free quantitative description of clustering, we therefore use the pair correlation function, which describes how the density of molecules varies as a function of distance from a reference molecule. In the case of RNAP localizations, the pair correlation function is evaluated by computing the Euclidean distances between all pairs of molecules in a single cell, and binning the results into a histogram of evenly spaced intervals. The segmented cell boundary is then used to generate a uniform (non-clustered) distribution of the same number of molecules throughout the cell volume. The distribution obtained from the experimental result is then normalized by this simulated distribution, to produce the pair correlation function. This process of normalization eliminates artefacts from the confining geometry of the cell. To avoid projection effects, the simulated molecules were distributed in a 3D volume generated by rotating the segmented cell boundary around its long axis, and then projected into 2D by removing one of these dimensions. In the resulting pair correlation function, g(r), molecules distributed evenly throughout the cell result in a flat distribution with g(r) = 1 for all values of r, whereas a population of molecules exhibiting clustering results in g(r) > 1 at short distances, and g(r) < 1 at long distances.

Analysis of

Cell boundaries were determined from brightfield images using the software microbeTracker to obtain the spatial location of individual molecules relative to the major and minor cell axes. These spatial locations were binned into a 2D histogram normalized by the cell length and width, to produce a heatmap which visualizes the spatial density of molecules. Heatmaps were produced for cells containing single and double nucleoids by applying a threshold for cell length (

In contrast to its profile in M9Glu, the Δ5 strain shows a profile similar to the WT for both mobile and immobile RNAPs, i.e. both populations are evenly distributed along the long axis of cells, and much of the immobile population seen in single cells appears clustered in a few foci (Figure

To explain the spatial distributions of immobile RNAPs, we consider that, during fast growth conditions in rich medium, cells contain multiple copies of the chromosome (

Our interpretation above is consistent with the location of RNAP clusters in single cells (e.g. Δ5 cells in Figure

To gain another perspective to RNAP clustering, we performed pair correlation analysis of the RNAP localizations (

We also performed pair correlation analysis in live cells in M9Glu. These experiments are complicated by any 3D motions of clustered RNAPs during the ∼8 min of imaging; such motions will reduce the pair correlation and spread it out to longer length scales; however, any persistent clustering should still be visible. Since we can separate the mobile and immobile RNAP species, we performed pair correlation analysis of the two species separately. Since we do not anticipate mobile RNAPs to be clustered (apart from exploring the entire nucleoid; as such, they do not fill the entire cell), this analysis should offer clearer views of the clustering of immobile RNAPs. Indeed, mobile RNAPs for all strains do not cluster (Figure

The presence of a well-defined location for the relocated rRNAPs in the case of M9Glu makes it unlikely that the released rRNAPs relocate to transcribe mRNA, since such a relocation would have resulted in a much more evenly distributed spatial profile for RNAP. Equally, our results are not consistent with rRNAP relocation to any RNAP-containing condensates not associated with transcription, since it is unlikely that such condensates will have the same spatial patterns as those dictated by the locations of the remaining chromosomal
