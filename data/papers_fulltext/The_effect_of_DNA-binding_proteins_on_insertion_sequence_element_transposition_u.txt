Since their discovery, transposable elements (“jumping genes”) have been studied in prokaryotic and eukaryotic models. In both types of organisms, they are best known for their ability to insert into variable locations within an organism’s genome (

One of the best characterized examples of this phenomenon is IS (Insertion Sequence) element insertion into the

Since mutations are widely considered by the scientific community to be random events rather than environmentally directed, the above facts indicate that the

As noted above,

Since the hydrogen bonds between individual base pairs are relatively weak in a SIDD site, the opening of the DNA may be what allows IS insertion to occur there with increased frequency. This would support previous unpublished findings that H-NS lowers the rate of insertion into the

Integration Host Factor (IHF) is a heterodimeric global histone-like DNA-binding protein involved in several cellular functions including transcriptional regulation, DNA recombination, and chromosome compaction (

Crp is a DNA-binding protein that relies upon cyclic AMP (cAMP) to become activated (

In this work, we provide evidence that two DNA-binding proteins affect the rate of IS insertion into

Since our view of IHF’s effect proved to be relevant to other operons, the question remained: What is the mechanism of the IHF effect on transposition? First, we tested whether the DNA-binding ability of IHF was the cause of the observed multi-operon effect. A mutation assay was performed comparing WT and ∆

Binding of IHF is necessary to effectively exert its positive effect on IS insertion upstream of the

To confirm these results, the G62E constructs were also used in mutation assays for the

Research conducted by other laboratory groups had demonstrated that IHF binding sites are present at both ends of IS1 and on one end of IS5 (hereafter referred to as IS5C; IS5A is the end without an IHF binding site) (

IHF does not influence transcriptional activity of IS1 or IS5.

To test whether Crp (when activated by cAMP) affects the rate of insertional mutations in the upstream region, two types of mutation assays were conducted. Simply testing a ∆

Another possibility is that this strain is in fact expressing IHF at levels higher than WT, but that this has an overall negative effect on mutation frequency. For example, these increased levels of expression may be toxic to the cell, or the increased binding of IHF to the multitude of its recognized binding sites may have pleiotropic effects that lead to lower growth rates, and consequently less insertion.

A final possibility is related to the fact that IHF levels increase greatly when the cell is starving (
