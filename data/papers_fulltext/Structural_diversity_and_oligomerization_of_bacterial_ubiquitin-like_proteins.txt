Ubiquitination is a multi-step enzymatic cascade in which ubiquitin or a ubiquitin-like protein (Ubl) becomes covalently linked to a target - typically a lysine side chain or other amine group - through the sequential action of E1, E2, and (usually) E3 proteins

In eukaryotes, Ubls typically comprise a single small domain with a fold termed “β-grasp”

To comprehensively characterize the architectural diversity of bacterial Ubls, we took advantage of recent studies that identified hundreds of bacterial operons encoding different combinations of ubiquitination-related proteins, particularly those that encode a predicted Ubl. These operons fall into two major groups termed Bil (

We used protein sequence alignments and structure predictions from ESMFold

As in Type II Bil, Ubls from Type I and II Bub operons Ubls show diverse predicted architectures: 218 (40%) contain a single predicted β-grasp domain, 38 (7%) contain two β-grasp domains, and 286 (53%) contain three β-grasp domains (

We performed size exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) on six Ubl proteins with different predicted architectures: two encoding two predicted β-grasp domains (Ubl

It is now understood that bacteria possess a range of biochemical pathways related to eukaryotic ubiquitination, which mediate protein conjugation in a variety of contexts including antiphage immunity

While bacterial Bil and Bub pathways encode Ubls with high structural similarity to eukaryotic ubiquitin, Ubl-target conjugation in bacteria is unlikely to constitute a degradation signal as it does in eukaryotic cells. Therefore, the functional consequences of Ubl-target conjugation in bacteria remains a key unanswered question. For one Type I Bil system, specific Ubl conjugation to phage central tail fiber proteins was shown to disrupt assembly of virions and also impair infectivity of fully-assembled virions

A widespread group of bacterial Ubl proteins found in both Type II Bil and Type I/II Bub pathways is the Ubl

Bacterial Ubls show high diversity, possessing one to three β-grasp domains and N-terminal domains with unknown functions, some of which are predicted to mediate oligomerization. Just as bacterial ubiquitination-related pathways show high diversity and likely act in many stress-response contexts, bacterial Ubls likely have many roles that depend on their diverse architectures. Notably, a large proportion of bacterial Bub operons are associated with known DNA damage-responsive transcriptional regulators, including the WYL domain protein CapW/BrxR

To analyze bacterial Ubl diversity, Type II Bil operons identified by Chambers et al.

For characterization of oligomeric state by size exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS), 100 µl of purified proteins at a concentration of 5 mg/ml were injected onto a size exclusion column (Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL, Cytiva) in size exclusion buffer, then light scattering and differential refractive index (dRI) profiles were collected using miniDAWN TREOS and Optilab T-rEX detectors (Wyatt Technology). SEC-MALS data were analyzed using ASTRA software version 8 and visualized with Prism version 10 (GraphPad Software). For analysis of divalent cations’ role in oligomerization, proteins were pre-incubated in size exclusion buffer plus supplemented with 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl

Grids were mounteds into standard AutoGrids (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for imaging. An initial dataset was collected on a Talos Arctica transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 200 kV and equipped with a Gatan K3 direct electron detector. Movies were collected at a magnification of 130,000x and a pixel size of 0.95 Å, with a total dose of 55 e-/Å

All data processing was performed using cryoSPARC version 4

The final dataset was collected on a Titan Krios G4 transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 300 kV and configured for fringe-free illumination, equipped with a Falcon 4 direct electron detector with Selectris X energy filter. The microscope was operated in EFTEM mode with a slit width of 20 eV. Automated data acquisition was performed using EPU (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Movies were collected at a magnification of 130,000x and a pixel size of 0.935 Å, with a total dose of 45 e-/Å

Particle picking in the final dataset was performed using templates generated from the 3.4 Å map from the initial dataset, in the Filament Tracer job. The filament diameter was set to 200 Å and the separation distance between picks was set to 0.14 diameters, enabling picking of adjacent asymmetric units along the helical filament. Particles were picked with a 320×320 pixel box size and Fourier cropped to 80×80 pixels for initial processing. 1,634,973 particles were subjected to four successive rounds of 2D classification (in rounds 1 and 2, the data were split into three batches), yielding a final set of 892,949 particles.

For modeling, initial models of each β-grasp domain generated by AlphaFold 2 were manually placed, then the model was manually rebuilt in COOT with manual addition of ordered Ca
