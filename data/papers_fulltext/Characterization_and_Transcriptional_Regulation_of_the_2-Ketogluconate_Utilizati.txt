We have found a promoter in the upstream of

We further constructed four knockout strains (named JUIM01Δ

According to existing studies, 2KGA is synthesized in the periplasmic space and then secreted into the extracellular space or enters the cytoplasm for metabolism in

During 2KGA fermentation, when the substrate glucose is completely consumed, the produced 2KGA is then utilized by

In industrial production, the reuse of 2KGA by production strains is a problem that is detrimental to the final yield. In the 2KGA utilization experiments, the utilization of 2KGA by JUIM01Δ
