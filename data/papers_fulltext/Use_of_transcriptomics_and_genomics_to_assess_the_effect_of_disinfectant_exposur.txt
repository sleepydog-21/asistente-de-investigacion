Disinfectants are antimicrobial agents that are widely used in homes, healthcare facilities and farm environments to reduce levels of bacterial and viral contamination. In hospitals and farms, they help prevent microbial cross-contamination, maintain biosecurity and reduce the incidence of healthcare-associated infections, especially during a disease outbreak. There are many disinfectants on the market with different active ingredients and different modes of action (

Bacteria can become resistant to disinfectants through intrinsic mechanisms (

The effect of environmental conditions, including the gut environment, on gene expression has been assessed in O157. It is known that stresses such as low-level chlorine or hypochlorite exposure can induce transcriptional changes in O157 (

The study aimed to elucidate the transcriptional and adaptive changes (mutations) that can occur in

TUV93-0, a laboratory-adapted derivative of EDL933 (

Four disinfectants were selected, representing different chemical compositions commonly used on farms. Those selected contained the following active ingredients: peroxymonosulphate (PMS), quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) and glutaraldehyde, iodophor (IOD) and chlorocresol (CRE). In addition, a second disinfectant (QAC2), which contained quaternary ammonium compounds, was used for selected experiments. General Orders (GO) concentrations for each Defra-approved disinfectant are available.

The survival and growth kinetics of TUV93-0 were determined using the FLUOstar (BMG, Labtech). TUV93-0 was grown for 16 h at 37°C in LB broth, then diluted (1,100) into fresh broth, with 150 μL of the diluted cells aliquoted into the wells of a 96-well plate. The Cells were grown for 150 min at 37°C in the FLUOstar, with absorbance (600 nm) measured at 15 min intervals. After 150 min, 50 μL of the diluted disinfectant or WHO water (control) was added, and the growth was monitored for a further 21.5 h. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and the growth was compared to that of the cells grown in the presence of WHO water. The area under the curve (AUC) values were calculated for each growth curve using GraphPad Prism software.

TUV93-0 was grown overnight in LB broth at 37°C, then diluted (1:100) into fresh broth and grown for 2.5 h at 37°C with shaking (150 rpm) until the disinfectant was added at sub-inhibitory concentrations and grown for a further 21.5 h. The following day, the cultures were diluted (1:100), and the exposure was repeated every 24 h for a total of 72 h. After each passage, a sample of the cells was frozen at-80°C for future analysis.

The frozen stocks of

For the selected mutants obtained following repeated disinfectant exposure, Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined for ampicillin (Amp), tetracycline (Tet), chloramphenicol (Chl) and nalidixic acid (Nal) using agar dilution methods described elsewhere (

The derivatives of TUV93-0 generated by disinfectant exposure and selected from 8Nal were assessed for mutations in

The selected isolates were whole genome sequenced (WGS) to identify the SNPs associated with antimicrobial resistance (AMR). DNA was extracted using the MagMAX CORE nucleic acid purification kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) and a KingFisher duo prime. The DNA was sequenced on the MiSeq platform (Illumina) following library preparation using Nextera XT. TUV93-0 was assembled with SPAdes 3.12 (

RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to assess the effect of disinfectant exposure on gene expression. RNA was isolated from the TUV93-0 cells exposed to the PMS disinfectant and QAC disinfectant at final concentrations of 0.125% w/v and 0.002% v/v, respectively, for 24 h at 37°C. The RNA was stabilised using a solution of 95% Ethanol and 5% phenol for a minimum of 30 min and then frozen at-80°C until the RNA was extracted. The RNA was extracted from the pelleted cells using the SV total RNA isolation kit (Promega).

Ribosomal RNA was removed using the Ribo-Zero bacterial rRNA depletion kit (Illumina) with 2.5 μg of total RNA, following the manufacturer’s protocol. The remaining RNA was purified using magnetic beads and a modified RNAeasy MinElute clean-up method (Promega). The RNA was then converted to cDNA by reverse transcription using random hexamers (Roche or similar). The RNA samples were mixed with 400 μM of the random hexamers and incubated at 70°C for 10 min. The cDNA reaction mix contained AMV-reverse transcription buffer (1x), 100 mM DTT, 10 mM dNTPs, 12.5 U of Protector RNase inhibitor and 25 U of AMV reverse transcriptase and was incubated at 25°C for 10 min followed by 42°C for 60 min. The cDNA synthesis system (Roche or similar) was used to generate the second strand of the cDNA. The samples were purified using magnetic beads (AMPure, Agencourt) according to the manufacturer’s instructions before the ligation of the sequencing primer. The Nextera XT kit was used to generate the sequencing libraries before sequencing on the NextSeq (Illumina).

Reads in the fastq files were trimmed using trimmomatric (Version 0.39;

A summary of the number of the differential expression genes found from four comparisons involving TUV-93 and the adapted strains QAC4 and QAC8 (adjusted

*Group names include the strain tested (TUV93 and the adapted strains QAC4 and QAC8) and treatment (the PMS disinfectant, QAC disinfectant, and water).

The sub-lethal concentration was determined for each disinfectant so that these levels could be used to assess transient and permanent genomic changes. For the O157:H7 strain TUV93-0, the lowest lethal concentrations were 0.5x (0.58% (v/v)) and 0.25x (0.25% (w/v)) GO strength for iodophor disinfectant (IOD) and peroxymonosulphate disinfectant (PMS), respectively. The chlorocresol-containing disinfectant (CRE) and glutaraldehyde and quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) inhibited the growth at much lower concentrations of 0.033x GO (0.067% (v/v)) and 0.002x GO (0.004% (v/v)), respectively. No growth inhibition was observed in the water control. Therefore, sub-lethal was defined as the highest concentration of the disinfectants at which growth was observed. Although the maximum OD 600 nm achieved after 24 h growth was lower for some disinfectants compared to the water control (

Two isolates (QAC4 and QAC8) generated following passage in the QAC disinfectant were selected for transcriptome analysis using RNA-seq. These isolates were selected because QAC4exhibited a high MIC for Chl and Tet () and QAC8 exhibited an elevated MIC for Nal without topoisomerase mutations ().

The study aimed to determine how

The PMS-containing disinfectant elicited transcriptional changes in a wide range of genes associated with various cellular processes. One might expect differential expression of membrane-associated genes, transporter proteins and genes associated with stress response as they protect cell integrity from the deleterious effects of disinfectants. A number of these were identified. Porins play a role in the movement of chemicals, including antibiotics, across the cell membrane. Differential expression of

Therefore, this study demonstrated that in the presence of sub-lethal disinfectant levels, bacteria can adapt to survive. Crucially, we noted that even short-term exposure to some disinfectants was sufficient to elicit these changes both in the genome and transcriptome of
