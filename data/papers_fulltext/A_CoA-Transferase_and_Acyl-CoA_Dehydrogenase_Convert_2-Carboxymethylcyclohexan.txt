The molecular masses of the purified polypeptides were determined by reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate−polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS − PAGE) (Bio‐Rad, Feldkirchen, Germany) and Blue Native PAGE was performed to estimate the native molecular weight (Invitrogen, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. The molecular mass of the native protein complex was furthermore estimated by size exclusion chromatography with an Ekta purifier (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden), equipped with a Superose 6 column (10 × 300 mm, Cytiva) that was equilibrated with 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0 and 250 mM NaCl.

Analysis of enzyme reactions was performed by with a Shimadzu high‐performance liquid chromatography LC‐2040C system coupled to a LCMS‐2020 single quadrupole mass‐spectrometer (Shimadzu) (LC–MS). Samples were separated via a Nucleodur C18 Gravity‐SB column (100 × 3 mm, 5 μm particle size, Macherey‐Nagel) at 35°C.

Infrared spectroscopy (IR) and vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra of the enantiopure non‐CoA derivative of the real substrate of dehydrogenase ThnO were recorded with a Bruker Invenio‐R/PMA 50 VCD spectrometer. The IR and VCD spectra were simulated from the single‐conformer spectra for final comparison with the experimental data. Additionally, crystals suitable for single crystal X‐ray analysis were obtained after slow evaporation of a solution of the enantiopure non‐CoA derivative of the real substrate, and data were collected on a Bruker D8 Venture at 100(2) K. The structure was subsequently solved. Detailed procedures for VCD spectroscopy and X‐ray crystallography are provided in Data

To identify if the CoA thioester is attached at the carboxyl or the carboxymethyl residue in the isomeric mixture of 2‐(carboxymethyl)cyclohexane‐1‐carboxylic acid CoA thioesters, produced by cell‐free extracts, we selectively removed one of the isomers—occupying the right peak (retention time 9.0 min) of the doublet in the LC chromatogram (Figure

GC–MS measurements were performed with an Agilent 8890 GC system coupled to an Agilent 7010B GC/MS Quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA). The injection was carried out by an Automated Liquid Sampler (Model: G4567A; Agilent Technologies). One microliter of sample was analysed with a 1:10 split injection and a ZB‐SemiVolatiles column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0,25 μm; Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany). The temperature gradient was 0–1 min isothermal at 35°C as initial condition, 1–1.4 min linear to 50°C with 40°C/min, 1.4–55.4 min linear to 320°C with 5°C/min and 55.4–65.4 min isothermal at 320°C, followed by cooling down and a post run of 1 min at 50°C. Helium was used as the carrier gas with a constant flow rate of 1.3 mL/min. The mass spectrometer was equipped with a High‐Efficiency Source (Agilent Technologies). The positive ionisation was carried out at a source temperature of 230°C and an electron energy of 70 eV.

To investigate the activity of the two acyl‐CoA dehydrogenase candidates, the natural substrate was synthesised biologically with cell‐free extracts of strain N47. THN‐CoA was converted to CoA thioesters of 2‐(carboxymethyl)cyclohexane‐1‐carboxylic acid with N47 cell free extract by using NADPH as electron donor of THN‐CoA reductase and CoA‐SH as CoA donor for the downstream β‐oxoacyl‐CoA thiolase (Figure

After adding 23 μg of the purified recombinant acyl‐CoA dehydrogenase ThnO to the produced compound, the right peak (retention time 8.7 min) of 2‐(carboxymethyl)cyclohexane‐1‐carboxylic acid CoA thioesters diminished completely within 15 min, whereas the left peak (retention time 8.6 min) decreased only slightly (Figure

Similar results were observed with 53 μg purified recombinant enzyme ThnT (approximately 18 μg of actual ThnT protein based on a purity of 34%) (Figure

Theoretically, the dehydrogenase reaction catalysed by ThnO/ThnT could take place at the acetyl‐CoA side chain of the 2‐(carboxymethyl)cyclohexane‐1‐carboxylic acid CoA thioesters or at the carboxyl‐CoA with a dehydrogenation in the ring (Figure

We interpret these results as such that ThnP is a CoA‐transferase that catalyses an intramolecular CoA‐transfer between the carboxyl‐ and the carboxymethyl‐residue of 2‐(carboxymethyl)cyclohexane‐1‐carboxylic acid CoA thioester. Without the CoA‐transferase ThnP, the dehydrogenase ThnO can only oxidise the 2‐(carboxycyclohexyl)acetyl‐CoA. This leads to the decrease of only the right peak (retention time 9.0 min) of the 2‐(carboxymethyl)cyclohexane‐1‐carboxylic acid CoA thioesters in (Figure

To confirm the assignment of the two substrate peaks to isomers with distinct side chains, we selectively removed one of the substrates using a dehydrogenase assay (Figure

We demonstrated the activity of the CoA‐transferase ThnP, which performs an intramolecular CoA transfer between 2‐(carboxymethyl)cyclohexane‐1‐carboxyl‐CoA and 2‐carboxycyclohexylacetyl‐CoA. When the CoA thioester of 2‐(carboxymethyl)cyclohexane‐1‐carboxylic acid was prepared in cell free extract, it clearly exhibited a mixture of the two isomers (compounds 16 and 17 in Figure

CoA transferases typically catalyse the intermolecular CoA transfer between disparate CoA donors and acceptors. In contrast, ThnP selectively catalyses an intramolecular CoA transfer but lacks the ability to utilise alternative CoA donors for intermolecular CoA transfer. The intramolecular transfer of the CoA moiety preserves the energy‐rich CoA thioester bond, preventing the release of the free acid or the transfer of CoA to other receptors, thereby avoiding the loss of intermediates and the need for additional ATP to activate the free acid (Pfister, Zarzycki, and Erb

The best‐studied intramolecular CoA transferases are succinyl‐CoA:phenylsuccinate CoA‐transferases (exhibits both inter and intramolecular transfer properties) involved in anaerobic metabolism of auxin in

The absence of the conserved active site glutamate in ThnP, which is typically found in family I CoA transferases, raises questions about its catalytic mechanism. According to the alpha fold model of ThnP, a glutamate E269 is in a topologically similar position with the active site E238 of 4‐hydroxybutyrate CoA‐transferase (Protein Data Bank entry 3GK7) belonging to the Cat1 family (Figure

An alternative explanation for the possibility that E269 facilitates the nucleophilic attack necessary for CoA transfer, ThnP may employ a novel mechanism that involves forming an internal anhydride intermediate, rather than an enzyme‐bound acyl‐glutamyl anhydride. The internal anhydride would be formed through nucleophilic attack by the acetate side chain of the substrate 2‐(carboxymethyl)cyclohexane‐1‐carboxy‐CoA on its acyl‐CoA carbonyl group, followed by the attack of CoA thiolate on the carbonyl of the internal anhydride adduct (Figure

A notable feature of the intermolecular CoA transferase formyl‐CoA: oxalate CoA‐transferase, belonging to family III/Frt group, is the presence of a flexible tetra‐glycine loop (Figure

A similar flexible QXGhG loop (X for any amino acid and h for a hydrophobic amino acid) can be found in the intermolecular CoA transferases of the family I/Cat1 group (Figure

Based on the identification of CoA‐transferase, acyl‐CoA dehydrogenase and its product 2‐carboxycyclohexylideneacetyl‐CoA, we hereby establish a modified metabolic pathway (Figure

Here, we demonstrated that the downstream pathway of anaerobic naphthalene degradation started with 2‐(carboxymethyl)cyclohexane‐1‐carboxyl‐CoA where the intramolecular CoA‐transferase ThnP produces 2‐carboxycyclohexylacetyl‐CoA. The following dehydrogenation is catalysed by ThnO at the acetyl‐CoA thioester. This reaction is probably followed by a hydratase and a novel lyase reaction acting at an intermediate with a tertiary hydroxyl‐group to open the ring. The elucidation of the reactions catalysed by ThnO and ThnP sheds further light on the anaerobic naphthalene degradation pathway at the point initiating the second ring cleavage.
