Allantoin is abundant in bacteria, fungi, animals and plants as an intermediate of purine degradation via uric acid

Extracellular allantoin is converted to glyoxylate in five steps. The first step involves a putative allantoin transporter YbbW (TC# 2.A.39.3.8), which belongs to the Nucleobase:Cation Symporter Family (TC# 2.A.39), all characterized members of which are transporters.

The allantoin degradation pathway in

The genes encoding the proteins of allantoin utilization are organized in 4 operons within a single gene cluster in

The glyoxylate branch point in allantoin utilization may provide a connection between purine catabolism and amino acid recycling through transamination between the unstable ureidoglycine and glyoxylate. Such an aminotransferase (PucG) has been biochemically characterized in

We have collaboratively investigated the existence of a network of protein–protein interactions (the interactome) in

When the cytoplasmic concentration of the AllR repressor’s effector, glyoxylate, increases, and the AllR-dependent

Here we characterize the allantoin transport activity, catalyzed by YbbW, which we have renamed as AllW, in the presence and absence of AllB. Stability and activity of the AllW transporter were both lost in the absence of AllB. An immunoprecipitation assay showed that no intact AllW protein could be detected following its overexpression in the absence of interaction with AllB, but a large peptide (30 KDa), derived from AllW, was present, providing evidence for proteolysis. An immunoprecipitation assay showed that the presence of glyoxylate stabilizes the interaction between AllW and AllB. AllW-His could be recovered in an intact form when binding AllB, but the same sample in the absence of AllB showed only the 30 kDa sized fragment of AllW.

AllB has an extremely high

To examine the AllB-AllW interaction in vivo, we expressed AllW-His from a plasmid, and AllB-Flag using its native chromosomal promoter (Fig.

AllB binds to and stabilizes AllW. FLAG-tagged AllB (AllB-Flag) was detected in total lysates (

For the immunoprecipitation assay, showing the AllB-GlxK interaction, AllB was labelled with a Flag-tag, and the His-tagged GlxK was overproduced from the ASKA collection (Fig.

AllB and GlxK interact in the presence of glyoxylate and allantoin. The interaction of His-tagged GlxK and FLAG-tagged AllB in the presence of glyoxylate or allantoin is shown by immunoblotting. (

Next, we examined the effect of glyoxylate on AllB_Zn activation in the presence of 0.3 μM GlxK (Fig.

Our data suggest that protein–protein interactions provide an important mechanism of metabolic control. In this case, we see how one protein can protect another when bound, and that a downstream enzyme in a pathway can activate a key upstream enzyme by increasing its substrate affinity, accelerating the rate of substrate degradation. In this case, GlxK may be a sensor for the level of the product of metabolism, glyoxylate. If so, it not only functions as a regulatory protein, it also serves as a sensor of the cellular metabolic state. Further studies are likely to reveal many more protein–protein interactions in the regulation of metabolism in all living cells. Elucidation of these interactions is expected to reveal complex networks interrelating many aspects of cellular physiology
