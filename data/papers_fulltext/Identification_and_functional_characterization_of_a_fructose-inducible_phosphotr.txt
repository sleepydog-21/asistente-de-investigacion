Bacteria transport sugars primarily via phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP): carbohydrate phosphotransferase systems (PTS), which phosphorylate sugars when they are transported inside the cell (

Since fructose feeds directly into glycolysis without isomerization or epimerization, it is considered an important sugar in the early evolution of the carbohydrate metabolic pathway in bacteria. It is also the first hexose synthesized through gluconeogenesis (

Upregulated proteins that are part of an operon or that are involved in a specific pathway and perform a common function

In addition, several proteins TssA, TssL, TssK, TssJ, TssB, TssC, TssHcp, TssF, VasG, and VgrG, which are known to constitute a T6SS were upregulated. We also found chemotaxis proteins, including CheR, CheA, CheW, and CheY of the Che1 system, CheB, MCP, and CheA of the Che4 system, and CheA and CheW of the Che2 system, a 28 kDa flagellin protein, the flagellar motor proteins MotA and MotB, and at least seven methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (

We also found upregulation of three proteins of the cytochrome c-oxidase operon, two proteins of the glycolate oxidase operon, the PQQ biosynthesis protein PqqBCD, two ABC transporters, six proteins of the xanthine dehydrogenase operon, four proteins of the molybdenum ABC transporter operon, the TonB system transporters ExbB, ExbD, and TonB, and two tripartite tricarboxylate transporters (
