Gram-negative bacteria possess multidrug efflux (MDR) pumps that are highly conserved within the species and between families (

Less understood are the biological roles of MDR pumps beyond the efflux of antibiotics or toxic compounds such as bile salts (

In

Here, we have examined the role of AcrR in regulating swimming motility in

Prior findings have shown that inactivation of the transcriptional repressor AcrR (Δ

To further investigate the role of AcrR as a direct regulator of motility in

We then computationally analyzed more in-depth the promoter regions of the four flagellum biosynthesis and motility genes identified as potential AcrR direct targets (

Predicted AcrR-binding sites in the four flagellum biosynthesis and motility genes/operons identified as direct target candidates of the AcrR repressor. (

AcrR directly binds to the

We next used EMSAs to determine whether purified AcrR directly binds to the promoter regions of the four flagellum and motility genes/operons identified as potential direct targets of AcrR (

The AcrR site in the

AcrR regulates the expression of the

AcrR represses swimming motility in

We next studied whether AcrR regulates swimming motility in

Finally, we tested whether AcrR played a role in the increased swimming motility previously found by Ruiz and Levy (

Model of the role of AcrR in co-regulation of efflux and motility in

Efflux and motility are major contributors to the ability of bacteria to grow, colonize, and survive toxic compounds or environmental changes (

Interestingly, a later study by Kim et al. (

First, we performed a genome-wide bioinformatics search of motility genes with promoters that contained predicted AcrR-binding sites using the known 24-bp AcrR-binding site in the

To further investigate the role of AcrR in repressing motility by directly repressing

To further test the hypothesis that AcrR directly represses the

Finally, we examined the role of AcrR in the interplay between the AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump and swimming motility in

Overall, these and prior findings portray a broader and more complex role of AcrR beyond being the local repressor of

The second premise is that AcrR senses the accumulation of antimicrobials and cellular metabolites that are AcrAB-TolC substrates, or their metabolic precursors or derivatives, because some of these compounds can function as ligands that bind to and inactivate AcrR (

The third premise is that AcrR is a direct regulator that, once it has sensed the accumulation of AcrAB-TolC substrates such as ethidium bromide, or cellular metabolites that may disrupt normal metabolic flow or be toxic, directly coordinates a broad cell response that involves efflux, metabolic and motility changes to cope with the accumulation of these substrates and/or their precursors or derivatives (

In conclusion, this manuscript combined bioinformatics, EMSA, gene expression, and motility assays to reveal that AcrR regulates motility in

RNAs were then diluted to a concentration of 50 µg/mL in RNase-free water before reverse transcribing 200 ng of each RNA using the Thermo Fisher Scientific RT Invitrogen SuperScript IV First-Strand Synthesis System Kit and random hexamers, with RNAse H treatment, according to the manufacturer’s specifications. RT minus reactions with water instead of reverse transcriptase were used as controls to confirm the lack of DNA contamination in the purified RNA samples.
