Approximately 0.5 μg of RNA per sample was converted to cDNA using the HiScript III 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (+ gDNA wiper) (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). Quantitative PCR was conducted using the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 6 Flex system (Applied Biosystems, USA) with ChamQ Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). The primers used for RT-qPCR analysis are listed in Additional file

For growth curve analysis,

To express the CadX homodimer, a linker sequence (GGGGSGGGGSGGGGS) was inserted between two identical CadX protein sequences and then ligated into the pET28a vector to produce pET28a-CadX, following a previously established protocol [

The promoter fragments of the target genes, as well as the 16S rRNA gene, were amplified by PCR with 2 × Rapid Taq Master Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) from the GZ0565 genome and purified using FastPure Gel DNA Extraction Mini Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). The DNA probes and CadX recombinant protein were incubated in a 20 µL reaction mixture (10 mM Tris, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl

The promoter fragments were amplified from the GZ0565 genome and ligated into the pTCV-
