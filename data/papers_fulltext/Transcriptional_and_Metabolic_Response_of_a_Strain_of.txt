The sensor histidine kinase ArcB represses genes encoding enzymes that catalyze the reaction of the TCA cycle. The DNA-binding transcriptional dual regulator ArcA is part of the ArcAB two-component system involved in response to respiratory conditions, and growth changes with a role in the anaerobic repression of genes associated with aerobic metabolism [

Upregulation of aerobic- and anaerobic-respiratory genes in both PB12 mutants indicates increased respiratory capabilities compared to the parental strain JM101, coupled with a possible higher availability of electron donor compounds from the TCA cycle. Additionally, the upregulation of several analyzed genes results from the proposed ArcAB

Fnr acts as a dimmer; in the presence of oxygen, the dimeric structure is converted to a monomeric form, reducing its ability to bind target DNA. Additionally, depending on the growth conditions, the proposed number of targets for Fnr and other global regulators varies (e.g., growing on a minimal M9 medium supplemented with glucose vs. growing in LB medium) [
