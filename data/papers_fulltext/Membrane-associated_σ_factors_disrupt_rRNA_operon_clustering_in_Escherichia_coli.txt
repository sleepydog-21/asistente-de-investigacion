Plasmids were constructed using Gibson assembly. Typically, 250 µL of the backbone was assembled with a molar equivalent of insert in a 20 µL reaction. The resulting product was purified with PCR clean-up kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Two microliters (2 µL) of the 20 µL eluted product was used for transformation. Colonies were screened by PCR with primers spanning the junction between the backbone and the insert. Positive clones were restruck and checked once more using the same primer pairs. The PCR product was sequenced to confirm the identity of the sequence at either the UT Core Sequencing Facilities or Eton Biosciences. For generating single-point mutants, primers carrying the desired mutation were used to amplify the plasmid of interest. The resulting PCR product was gel-extracted with Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit. The product was then self-ligated overnight with T4 DNA Ligase and T4 DNA PNK in T4 Ligase Buffer. The ligated product was then purified and 2 µL of the 20 µL eluted product was used for transformation. Positive clones carrying the desired mutation were identified by PCR of the target sequence followed by sequencing. The positive clones were then restruck once again and verified with PCR and sequencing.

Overnight cultures used for fluorescent microscopy were grown overnight in EZ-Rich media (Teknova) from a single colony and diluted 1:100 in fresh EZ-Rich media supplemented with IPTG for induction of ParB-fluorescent fusions from pFHC2973. The subculture grew until an O.D. of 0.4. One milliliter of the culture was then pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 µL of PBS. Six microliters of the suspension was then spotted onto agarose pad (1%) and let dry. The sample was then observed under Olympus-BX 53 microscope, XM10 monochrome camera on the 100× objective with oil immersion. Most images were taken at an exposure of ~100 ms for GFP filter, and ~400 ms for CFP filter, however, some samples required a longer exposure time to obtain acceptable signal for downstream processing; the upper limit of exposure was 3 s. Cellular stressors were applied 20 min prior to imaging, after which they were prepared and imaged as described above. For heat stress, the cells were transferred to a 42 °C water bath. SHX was added to a concentration of 50 µM. Cold stress was induced by incubating the cells in a 4 °C water bath. Ethanol stress was induced by adding ethanol to 0.5%. For image processing, the background was subtracted from the image, and foci were detected with ImageJ using the detect maxima function. The coordinates of the foci were exported and the Cartesian distance between a GFP focus, and its closest CFP focus was determined with custom Python script. The distance was computed by scaling the distance in pixel to nm with 1 pixel = 62 nm. Cell length was measured with ImageJ using the same scale as described above (1 pixel = 62 nm). For each experiment, three biological replicates were examined, and one representative is shown. Code used for analyzing the foci can be found at

Three independent overnight cultures of MG1655 carrying pKH5 and the corresponding gRNA were pelleted and washed as described above. The pellet was diluted 1:100 into 100 mL fresh LB supplemented with selection and 0.2% arabinose and aTc. The cultures were grown to an O.D. of 0.6 and pelleted and washed three times in 1 mL of PBS. The subsequent pulldown procedure was carried out as described by FLAG Immunoprecipitation kit (Rockland). Every step of the pulldown was conducted at 4 °C. Briefly, the pellet was resuspended in 5 mL of lysis buffer and sonicated (Brason tip, 40% intensity) for 10 min (10 s on, 10 s off cycle). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C. Agarose-αFLAG Ab was washed twice in PBS and once in elution buffer. The washed Agarose-αFLAG Ab was incubated with the lysate overnight. After incubation, the beads were collected and washed 3 times with PBS. The bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer. The proteins were quantified by Mass Spectrometry at the UT Proteomics core. Samples were digested with trypsin, desalted and run on Dionex LC (liquid chromatography) and Orbitrap Fusion 2 (mass spec machine) for 60 min. Raw data were analyzed with PD2.2 and Scaffold 5 software. Downstream analysis was performed as described in [

0.5 mL of three overnight cultures of the desired strain carrying the appropriate plasmid was pelleted and washed in 1 mL of PBS twice. The pellet was then resuspended in 0.5 mL of PBS and diluted 1:100 in LB. The cultures were grown to an O.D. of 0.4 and aTc was added. At indicated time points, 20 µL of the culture was withdrawn, its O.D. 600 recorded and added to 80 µL of permeabilization buffer (100 mM NaHPO

When required, a Mu prophage strain was grown overnight, diluted 1:100 in fresh LB and grown until an O.D. of 0.5. After which, the culture was shifted to a 42 °C water bath and incubated until lysis is complete. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 6000

REVIEWS:

Reviewer #1: In a previous study, the group of Prof. Harshey provided evidence for long-range interactions on the E. coli chromosome. Using a Mu-based transposition assay, they found that rrn loci clustered together, despite being located across the E. coli chromosome. They identified some DNA elements in the region of these loci as being essential for the clustering. In the present study, Ho and Harshey probe for proteins that may mediate this clustering. For this, they first screen for stress conditions where the clustering is disrupted. They identify ethanol and heat-shock stresses as two conditions where clustering is reduced. Next, they carry out a pull down (via dCasd9 targeting) of the clustered rrn operon regions. They find that GroEL is common across 4 of the rrn operons. Further probing reveals that perturbation in the GroEL-GroES ratios affects clustering, and this may be driven by sigma factor competition. The authors go on to shown that sigmaH (expressed during heat shock) can disrupt clustering, likely via competition with sigmaD. Mutational analysis suggests that this is not dependent on active transcription but relies on sigmaH association with DNA and its RNA polymerase interactions.

The study is interesting as it probes into the mechanism of rrn operon clustering in E. coli. Given the limited examples of such clustering in bacterial genomes, the findings will be of broad relevance to the chromosome biology community across bacteria and eukaryotic systems. I do have some points that authors should consider.

1. Comparison across diverse stressors. Authors use a diverse variety of stressors to assess which conditions affect rrn clustering. However, comparison across these conditions is challenging as they may not affect cell growth to the same extent. It is unclear what concentrations/ range of stress conditions were tried to enable reliable comparison across stringent response, cold shock, ethanol and heat shock.

2. Microscopy observations:

a. In all stress conditions, cell lengths and global chromosome condensation/ organization is subject to change when compared to wildtype. Hence it is insufficient to measure inter-locus distance between rrn loci alone. Authors should provide cell length distributions and DAPI staining analysis in all imaged conditions to show that cell lengths and chromosome compaction are comparable to wild type, even though the inter-locus distance is changing.

b. In addition, authors should measure the inter-locus distance between two chromosome loci known to not cluster, as a control to show that the sigma factor effects are specific to the rrn operons.

c. It is unclear what microscope was used for the imaging (details are missing in the methods). If this is widefield imaging, do the authors have the resolution power to differentiate across 216-230nm? In my experience any localizations below 250nm distances are not resolvable by widefield microscopy techniques and hence commenting on distance variations as small as a change from 216nm to 230nm is not reliable.

d. The violin plots of distances between loci have values below zero as well - is this possible?

3. dCas9 pull-down experiment: This is an excellent experiment for discovering proteins bound to these clusters. However, since this requires formaldehyde crosslinking, do the authors have confidence that any cluster-specific protein will still remain bound and be pulled-down? Authors need to clearly discuss this caveat of the experimental design.

4. Role of sigmaH in rrn operon clustering. Given that there could be global transcriptional changing during heat shock/ sigmaH overexpression, the decrease in rrn clustering could be due to more global changes to chromosome organization. Have the authors conducted experiments to see whether the sigmH-dependent declustering is specific to rrn operons, or whether such over-expression triggers more global changes in chromosome organization/ transcription (voa RNA-seq/ chromosome capture methods)?

5. Discussion section: This section is rather long, and mostly recapitulates the results. Authors should tighten this section significantly. The model suggests that sigmaH binds the inner-membrane and causes declustering. However, I am not clear as to how the inner membrane binding would cause this declustering. The model figure does not provide much insight into this proposed mechanism.

Minor comments:

1. Scale bar is missing in microscopy images

2. Please provide details of the number of biological replicates in each of the violin plots. Were these data pooled across replicates?

3. Upset plot in Fig. 3A is not readable

4. Please check the grammar for the discussion section L254-258.

Reviewer #2: The E.coli chromosome has seven ribosomal RNA operons and six of them show clustered spatial localization in the cell. In this manuscript by Ho and Harshey, the authors perturbed the cell using physical and chemical stresses including amino acid starvation, heatshock, coldshock and ethanol shock, and found that ethanol shock and heatshock disrupted the clustering. The authors went on the show that it is the elevated level of the sigma factor RpoH that disrupts the clustering of rrn operons. A similar effect was observed when FecI was expressed. Both RpoH and FecI associate with the cell membrane and both were counteracted by expression of sigma factor RpoD. The authors concluded rrn operons are clustered at the cell membrane directly or indirectly by RpoD.

This is a solid study involving a complementary approaches. The experiments were carefully executed, the results were critically analyzed and interpreted. The topic will be of broad interest to researchers that study chromosome biology field. However, I found some major gaps of understanding (see below). Filling these gaps could strengthen the authors' model:

1) One important component of the model is rrns are clustered at the cell membrane. The authors have a lot of images for the localization of rrns in the cells. When analyzing these data, is there evidence that the rrn loci are associated with the cell membrane? In other words, is there a tendency for the foci to be at the periphery of the cell?

2) Figure 2D. Why does heatshock reduce the copy number of rrnA but not rrnD? Because the number of foci are different, the absence of colocalization might be overestimated. In Figure 2CD or an SI figure, the authors should show a different pair of loci that have similar number of foci before and after RpoH expression.

3) GroEL is pulled down from 4/7 rrn operons. For dCas9 pulldown. It is unclear whether GroEL specifically get enriched at the rrn operons or it just has higher levels upon stress and get enriched everywhere. To distinguish these two possibilities, I suggest the authors do repeat dCas9 pulldown using one or two control loci that are not close to any rrn and examine GroEL enrichment.

4) Figure 6: Mu experiment. It looks like the strongest effect RpoH has is on the overall landscape of genome folding, and not specifically affecting rrn clustering. Then the question is: does RpoH specifically disrupt rrn flustering or does it lower chromosome interactions overall and the declustering of rrns is just a consequence of chromosome reorganization? Figure 6E-J showed lower interactions between rrnD and other rrns upon RpoH expression, does rrnD have lower interactions with non-rrn sites as well? If the authors have a Mu inserted in a non-rrn region (say geneX), then look at its interactions with regions (gene y, z, w, t etc) that are the same distance away as rrns away from rrnD, then measure the interaction between x-y, x-z, x-w, x-t, etc, before and after RpoH expression, does RpoH lower the interaction of these other loci pairs as well?

5) Figure 7 model: Where should be GroEL put in this model? RpoD not only bind to rrn promoters, but also bind to promoters of many housekeeping genes. What is preventing these other genes getting incorporated into the rrn clusters? Does the model predict that other highly transcribe genes (outside of rrn operons) are clustered with the rrns? Does Mu result support the idea the higher the expression of a gene, the more interactions it has with a rrn?

Reviewer #3: Review of Ho and Harshey, clustering of rRNA operons in E. coli is disrupted by sigma H

This manuscript is a follow up of the Harshey lab's seminal paper published in Cell in 2020, Walker et al. 180: 703-716. In that work, the authors found that 6 of the 7 rRNA operons in an E. coli cell (all except rrnC) are clustered in space in vivo. The authors find, using the Phage Mu method employed in the Cell paper and also by fluorescence microscopy using tags on the rRNA operons on the chromosome, that this clustering phenomenon is disrupted by heat shock or by expression of sigma 32 or sigma FecI, two inner membrane-associated sigma factors, but not by other sigma factors. Even a small increase in sigma 32 levels is sufficient for de-clustering, but transcription by Esigma32 is not required. Co-expression of sigma 70 with sigma 32 is sufficient to rescue clustering, suggesting that sigma 32 competes with sigma 70 to cause de-clustering of the physical contacts between the rRNA promoter regions. In an attempt to use mass-spec to identify proteins that cause clustering, the authors identify GroEL as making a contribution to clustering of 4 of the 6 clustered operons. The authors address other possible contributors, including condensate formation, concluding that RNAP condensates are a feature of highly active transcription units, but since neither NusB or RpoZ impact clustering whereas they are crucial for condensate formation, condensates are not responsible for rRNA operon clustering. In general, I found this paper very clear and well-written. I have only very very minor comments.

1. In many figures, fluorescent images are superimposed on phase contrast images. However, these are referred to as "bright field". My understanding is that these images are phase contrast, not "bright field" (which does not mean the same thing as phase contrast). Please correct the text, legends, and methods.

2. I had some difficulty determining on line 136 which panel in Fig. 3 the authors are referring to. I think it's the "red" plot that shows the increased distance, but describing this as the third plot is a bit confusing.

3. On line 139 the authors refer to Fig. 2D. Should this be Fig. 3D?

4. Would it be useful to point out in the text that the numbers above the plots in Figures 2B, 3D and E, and 4A and C are the numbers of pairs monitored, not the average distances between the rRNA operons? I found this confusing at first. An alternative solution would be to move the number of measured foci pairs to the legend or Methods (just saying 300-800 would be sufficient) and including the actual distances measured on the figure, so they match the text.

5. Line 357. The order of RNAP subunit assembly is alpha2 � alpha2- beta �alpha2- beta- beta prime � alpha2- beta- beta prime- omega. The earlier referenced Ishihama pathway was before recognition of the importance of omega for assembly and was superseded by the later reference (ref. 51). Including the earlier pathway might be confusing.

6. Fig 1. Perhaps it should be mentioned in the legend that the positions of the operons on the circular chromosome are not to scale.

7. The generic E. coli rRNA operon shown in Fig. 1 is pictured without a distal tRNA and is labeled as having a "variable tRNA" in the 16S-23S spacer. Three E. coli rRNA operons have a tRNA or two distal to the 23S or 5S genes. Perhaps to be more precise, it might be best to label the schematic operon as rrnG and indicate the identity of the spacer tRNA as tRNAGlu2 and also say that some operons have distal tRNAs.

8. I found a couple of typos: In ref. 37, Ciaran is the author's first name, the last name is Condon. Also, on line 400, the text should be "use of non-Mu" …

On behalf of my colleagues and the Academic Editor, Michael T. Laub, I am pleased to say that we can in principle accept your manuscript for publication, provided you address any remaining formatting and reporting issues. These will be detailed in an email you should receive within 2-3 business days from our colleagues in the journal operations team; no action is required from you until then. Please note that we will not be able to formally accept your manuscript and schedule it for publication until you have completed any requested changes.

IMPORTANT: Many thanks for citing the location of the raw data in the legend of Figure 1. However, we require this is done for every figure where raw data is available saying “The data underlying this Figure can be found in Supplemental “Raw Data” file”. I have asked my colleagues to include this request alongside their own.
