Chemical modification of RNA
occurs naturally in all phyla of life that includes over 140 different
structures.

Direct sequencing of RNA with nanopore
technology has the potential
to locate and quantify more than one modification in the strand.

Modifications to RNA resulting in base calling differences

enabled sequencing for pseudouridine (Ψ),

signatures, particularly in the ionic current and helicase dwell time

The approach outlined enabled us to systematically determine the
signatures for all modifications with a few exceptions (

or a Flongle flow cell (∼5 ng) and sequenced using the standard
