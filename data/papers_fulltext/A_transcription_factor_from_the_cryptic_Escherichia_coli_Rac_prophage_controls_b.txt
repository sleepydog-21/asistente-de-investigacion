Bacterial genetic networks include regulatory scaffolding, fundamental for coordination and maintenance of bacterial physiology and communication with the dynamic environment. The main components of the genetic networks are DNA-binding transcription factors (TFs), which modulate gene expression within operons and regulons. They can quickly adjust gene expression levels as needed. Approximately 300 TFs were detected or predicted in

One of the cryptic prophage unknown TFs is YdaT, whose gene is located in the immunity region of Rac in

Mapping the YdaT binding sites within Rac prophage

To identify YdaT-binding sites within its bound DNA fragment, we next performed DNaseI footprinting analysis, with YdaT WT and its nonbinding variant YdaTmut (H56A R57A). We found a 100 bp long DNA segment, which was protected from DNaseI treatment, unlike the same substrate with YdaTmut protein. The protected DNA was located in the range −60 bp to +40 bp where +1 refers to A of the start codon of the

For the second DNA substrate that had yielded a positive gel shift assay, we also performed DNaseI footprints analysis, in this case close to the start of

Given the similarity of the apparent binding sites, we sought to test whether YdaT of Rac binds the CP-933P prophage substrate and vice versa, and we were not surprised to see that the cross-binding did occur (Fig. 3B and C). We used an

YdaT is usually annotated in gene and protein databases as a putative bacterial toxin that is neutralized by the putative antitoxin YdaS. We and others have shown previously that both YdaT and YdaS are rather Rac prophage TFs [

A BLAST database search revealed that YdaT is easily identifiable in most

YdaT and CII protein from bacteriophage λ are analogs. (

Interestingly, the mode of action of YdaT resembles that of CII from Lambda phage, another well-studied TF. Structurally, these two proteins also share a similar architecture, with a crucial α-helix (α3 in both YdaT and CII) showing high sequence similarity (Fig.

Thus, we aimed to explore the toxicity more closely, but in Δrac cells to avoid the effect of other Rac regulators and genes.
