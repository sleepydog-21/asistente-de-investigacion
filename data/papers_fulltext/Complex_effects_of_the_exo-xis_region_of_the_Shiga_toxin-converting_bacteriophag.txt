When the lysogenic pathway is chosen, phage DNA is incorporated into

During the lytic development, there are many round of phage DNA replication, and the genes encoding head, tail, and lysis proteins are expressed. This leads to the assembly of many (100–200, on average, under optimal conditions) new phage particles within the cell. The development ends with disruption of the host cell and liberation of progeny virions.

Bacteria were routinely cultured in the Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (BioShop, Burlington, ON, Canada), supplemented with 10 mM CaCl

Bacteria lysogenic with tested bacteriophages, Φ24

Bacteriophage titration procedure was performed using standard Petri dishes filled with 25 ml of LA medium. Soft agar (0.7%), supplemented with 10 mM CaCl

To assess the kinetics of intracellular phage development, one-step growth experiment was performed according to the previously described procedure (Bloch et al.

To estimate the efficiency of lysogenization, the procedure described earlier (Dydecka et al.

To determine the survival of host bacteria after phage infection, the procedure described earlier (Dydecka et al.

The rate of adsorption of virions on the surface of host cells was determined according to the procedure described previously (Bloch et al.

Infection of host bacteria with tested phages was prepared according to the procedure described previously (Bloch et al.

For microarray analysis, total RNA was isolated from 7.5 × 10

Gene expression microarray analyses were carried out commercially by the Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Santa Clara, CA, USA) using Agilent’s

Preparation of cDNAs from 1.25 μg of RNA samples for RT-qPCR was performed with Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase (Roche Diagnostics International, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) and random hexamer primers (Roche Diagnostics International, Rotkreuz, Switzerland), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All obtained cDNAs were 10-fold diluted in DEPC-treated water (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and tested in RT-qPCR. Gene expression patterns were determined by RT-qPCR as described previously (Bloch et al.
