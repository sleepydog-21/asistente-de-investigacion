We also assessed the effect of phylogeny on genome size of host source. Human-associated genomes in human-dominated clades H2 and H1 displayed significantly higher genome lengths than human-associated genomes in ruminant-dominated clades R1 and R2, ruminant-associated genomes in any clade, and rodent-associated genomes in clade H2 (

Degradative CAZy families are differentially dense across source groups. CAZy family densities show the number of gene copies for each family per megabase pair. Leftmost dendrogram shows the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of degradative CAZy families (GH, PL, and CE) density across genomes. Dendrogram labels indicate each significantly dense CAZy family, and colored bubbles at the tips indicate families associated with algae degradation. CAZy families marked with an asterisk and background color indicate that the densest source group (background color) is significantly different from all groups. Panel immediately right of dendrogram displays the density (x-axis) of each CAZy family (y-axis) per genome (individual points) colored by source group. The following pane displays the mean CAZy family density (x-axis) in each source group represented by colored squares. Colored tiles on the right indicate the densest source group. Rightmost heatmap represents

CAZyme gene clusters (CGCs) are tightly linked clusters containing at least one CAZyme and at least one CGC signature gene that encodes for proteins, such as transporters (TCs), signal transduction proteins (STPs), or transcriptional factors (TFs) (

A total of 18 high-molecular DNA samples from sections III, IV, and V of the six fish were used for metagenomics. DNA libraries were prepared at the Otago Genomics Facility (University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand) with the Takara Thruplex DNA-Seq 96D kit (Takara Bio, Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan). Paired 125 bp reads were generated using the Illumina HiSeq V4 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), yielding 442.4 Gbp of sequence (

A subset of 13 samples (three section III, four section IV, and six section V) were used for metatranscriptomics based on detectable RNA of good quality. First, RNA was extracted, and DNA removed, with the Monarch Total RNA Miniprep Kit (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) following the manufacturer instructions. RNA yields were measured using Qubit and purity using a NanoPhotometer. DNA removal was confirmed by no amplification of the 16S rRNA gene in extracted versus positive control samples (

Raw metagenomic reads were trimmed and adapters were removed using BBMap version 37.93 with the BBDuk tool (parameters ktrim = r, k = 35, mink = 20, hdist = 1, tpe, tbo, qtrim = rl, trimq = 30, minlen = 80) (

Distinct CAZyme-encoding genes (e.g., different CAZy families and orthogroups) annotated as glycoside hydrolase (GH), polysaccharide lyase (PL), or carbohydrate esterase (CE) within the same CGCs were combined into unique pairs (
