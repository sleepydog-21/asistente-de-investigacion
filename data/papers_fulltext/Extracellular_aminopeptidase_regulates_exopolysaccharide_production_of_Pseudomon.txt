In natural environments, bacteria predominantly exist within biofilms, wherein bacterial cells are encased in a self-secreted extracellular matrix. The biofilm matrix typically comprises extracellular proteins, exopolysaccharides, and extracellular DNA (eDNA), which collectively maintain the structural integrity of the biofilm and facilitate bacterial survival under harsh environmental conditions [

Previous studies have reported that PaAP is secreted out of the bacterial cells as an inactive form, and cleavage at its C-terminus can activate its peptidase activity [

Taken together, the data in this study indicate that the LasI-activated extracellular aminopeptidase PaAP has the ability to feedback regulate its own expression by inhibiting

PaAP regulates the production of Psl exopolysaccharides through a feedback regulation on QS system. PaAP associates with Psl exopolysaccharides extracellularly to make sure that PaAP functions as a nutrient recycler in a zone close to Psl-producing cells. PaAP regulates the production of Psl in a QS-dependent manner during biofilm development. At the early stage of biofilm development where cell density is low, PaAP is expressed at a low level. Bacteria are able to produce Psl and attach to surfaces or to each other to start a biofilm. As biofilm matures, cell density is high and QS signaling molecules are accumulated. Both PaAP and Psl are highly expressed. However, PaAP limits QS signaling via short peptides cleaved from pro-PaAP and subsequently repressed

Both extracellular proteins and exopolysaccharides are major components of the bacterial biofilm matrix. However, little is known about whether and how these components interact. PaAP is one of the most abundant proteins in the matrix of

We previously reported that Psl is anchored to the bacterial surface and also forms a fiber-like matrix that enmeshes bacteria within a biofilm [

As a key component of biofilm scaffolding, Psl plays a crucial role in determining the biofilm formation ability of

We have further demonstrated that the control of Psl exopolysaccharides by PaAP is mediated through QS signaling molecule, LasI. The expression of PaAP is known to be induced by LasI/LasR system. Here, we discover that extracellular PaAP exhibits feedback regulation on the transcription of
