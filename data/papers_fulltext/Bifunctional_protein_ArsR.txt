Arsenic, classified as a Group 1 human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, is the most prevalent water and environmental toxin [

In the environment, inorganic arsenic exists in various chemical forms, including arsenate [As(V)], arsenite [As(III)], elemental arsenic [As(0)], and arsine [As(− 3)]. The predominant forms in oxic and reducing environments are As(V) and As(III), respectively [

Arsenic resistance (

In this study, a roxarsone-resistant strain, M20, was isolated from aquaculture sewage and identified as

Aquaculture sewage was sampled from the influx of a wastewater treatment facility in Shandong Province, China. The sewage samples were diluted and spread onto Luria–Bertani (LB)-agar plates (0.5% w/v yeast extract, 1% w/v tryptone, 1% w/v sodium chloride, 2% w/v agar) containing 30 µM roxarsone (filtered through a 0.22 µM micro-filtration membrane) (Sigma Co., Shanghai, China), which were then incubated at 28 °C for 24 h. All colonies with different phenotypes on the plate were selected and cultivated three to five consecutive times on LB-agar medium containing 30 µM roxarsone to obtain pure cultures of single colonies. One colony, named M20 (Table

The ability of ArsR

Strain M20 was isolated from aquaculture sewage under the pressure of 30 µM roxarsone, an organic compound of arsenic. MIC analysis revealed that strain M20 was also resistant to inorganic arsenic compounds, such as NaH
