Protein conformational flexibility is intimately connected with both protein aggregation and degradation, as protein unfolding is a key step in proteolytic pathways while conformational rearrangements are involved during nucleation and growth of aggregates (

β-galactosidase is necessary for lactose metabolism in

Structurally, LacZ is a tetrameric protein (

Previous studies focusing on gene expression costs in the

We address the in vivo proteolytic stability of LacZ, from polypeptide expression to oligomerization of monomers and dimers into functional LacZ tetramers. To probe the mechanism of LacZ’s proteolytic stability, we destabilize LacZ using a set of ssrA tags spanning a range of degradation rates, and use the Miller assay to measure LacZ activity levels (

We engineered

To evaluate the degradation of LacZ, we measured LacZ activity levels using the Miller assay during growth in glucose and lactose transitions (

To obtain a positive control for degradation, we used a functional, chromosomally encoded LacZ-GFP fusion protein (

Degradation assay and microfluidic measurements for strain expressing the ssrA-tagged LacZ-GFP fusion. (

To determine whether the ssrA-tagged GFP was degraded when fused to LacZ, we attached two additional ssrA tags (ssrA

Maturation of the LacZ polypeptide into functional LacZ protein involves several steps, including folding of monomers, dimerization, and tetramerization (

To measure the dynamics of α-complementation during induction starting from a fully uninduced state and a fully expressed α-peptide, we grew the

Previously, it was found that monomers and dimers of LacZ aggregate in vitro (

Proteotoxic stress phenotypes of tetramerization-deficient LacZ expressing strains. (

To uncover if other proteotoxic stress phenotypes were associated with aggregates in vivo, we grew the strains with and without aTc, measured their cell densities, and calculated their growth rate dynamics. We found that in the presence of aTc, the

To determine whether the mechanism of proteolytic stabilization of LacZ is consistent with the observed lactose induction kinetics of the WT and ssrA-tagged strains, we fit the measurements using a biophysical model. The model’s dynamical variables are the LacZ monomer (

The duration of the lag phase is determined by both the basal LacZ monomer production rate,

We used a modified version of the above model to estimate the rates of α-complementation in the

We followed the course of β-galactosidase proteolysis and found that tetramerized LacZ is protected from degradation when attached with ssrA tags (

To reach our conclusion regarding the lack of degradation of functional LacZ, we attempted to increase the likelihood of degradation in several ways. First, we attached flexible peptide linkers which would increase the accessibility of the ssrA tag to the SspB adapter protein. Even with a more accessible ssrA tag, functional LacZ was not degraded (

By preventing the tetramerization of LacZ using the

Our findings support a simple biophysical model with three molecular species: monomeric, tetrameric, and aggregated LacZ (

The degradation rate that we infer for the

Our visualization of aggregation in vivo revealed that in a subset of cells, the aggregates were surrounded by a membrane. We speculate that aggregates may sterically exclude the nucleoid leading to a nucleoid-free space, which enables membrane invagination through ectopic engulfment by the divisome (

In uncovering the mechanism of proteolytic stability of LacZ, we harnessed the power of ssrA tags, which are becoming a major tool in studying bacterial physiology and in synthetic biology applications (
