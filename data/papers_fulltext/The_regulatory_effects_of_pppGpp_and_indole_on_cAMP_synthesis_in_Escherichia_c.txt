The adaptation of bacteria to stress is based on a subtle tuning
of regulatory networks by the changes in gene expression and
enzyme activity. Furthermore, the metabolic products of bacterial
cells, such as indole and second messengers (
p)ppGpp
and cAMP, are regulatory signals. The interaction of the metabolic
pathways of these signaling molecules ensures the
adaptation of bacteria to various changes in the environment,
which is of great scientific interest

Among the currently known nucleotide second messengers,
cAMP (3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate) and (p)ppGpp
(guanosine tetra(penta)phosphate) were the first to be studied
in most detail in the model organism Escherichia coli. They
act as intracellular “secondary” signals, transducing information
about the actual microenvironment of bacterial cells by
transforming the extracellular “primary” signals into a cascade
of intracellular physiological changes necessary to support
important biological functions (Hengge et al., 2019).

cAMP is synthesized by the enzyme adenylate cyclase,
encoded by the cyaA gene, that catalyzes the cyclization
reaction of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to form cAMP and
inorganic pyrophosphate (Botsford, Harman, 1992) and is
cleaved to form AMP by means of phosphodiesterases CpdA
(Imamura et al., 1996) and DosP (Yoshimura-Suzuki et al.,
2005). The global regulator cAMP plays an important role in
many biological processes, including the regulation of growth,
differentiation and general cell metabolism, division, starvation,
anaerobiosis, carbon metabolism, stress reactions (Gosset
et al., 2004), osmoregulation (Balsalobre et al., 2006), and
quorum sensing (Zhou et al., 2008). Transcriptomic analysis
has shown that more than 200 operons are under direct or indirect
control of cAMP (Gutierrez-Ríos et al., 2007). cAMP in
complex with the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) (Rickenberg,
1974) regulates the transcription of several hundred genes,
some of which are involved in catabolic processes (Botsford,
Harman, 1992), and thus participates in multiple regulatory
networks.

Another well-known second messenger, (p)ppGpp, induces
one of the main bacterial adaptive mechanisms – the stringent
response (Potrykus, Cashel, 2008; Hauryliuk et al., 2015),
affecting various aspects of bacterial physiology, such as persistence,
virulence, biofilm formation, and others (Dalebroux
et al., 2010; Maisonneuve, Gerdes, 2014). Since the (p)ppGpp
alarmone is a global regulator that controls the expression of
about 1,400 genes (Traxler et al., 2008), its main function is to
regulate the growth and survival of bacterial cells in response
to nutrient deficiency and various stress factors (Hengge et
al., 2019). Elevated levels of (p)ppGpp delay bacterial growth
by suppressing the production of RNA, DNA, and proteins
(Mechold et al., 2013). In E. coli cells, (p)ppGpp levels are
determined by the balance between two alarmone synthetases
RelA/SpoT, the homologues of (RSH) protein family – RelA
with only synthesizing activity and the bifunctional enzyme
SpoT, which exhibits both (p)ppGpp synthetase and hydrolase
activities. RelA synthetase is activated upon binding to
ribosomes during amino acid starvation, when uncharged
tRNAs bind to the A site of the ribosome. SpoT-dependent
accumulation of (p)ppGpp in bacterial cells occurs when
there is a lack of carbon sources, fatty acids, iron, nitrogen,
phosphates, as well as under oxidative stress, etc. (Arenz et al.,
2016). In E. coli cells, (p)ppGpp regulates gene transcription
by changing the activity of RNA polymerase via direct interaction
with the enzyme or indirectly, reducing the cellular pool
of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and, accordingly, the ATP/
GTP ratio as a result of the consumption of GTP for (p)ppGpp
synthesis (Dalebroux, Swanson, 2012; Hauryliuk et al., 2015).

Indole, a signaling molecule of stationary phase bacterial
cells, also takes part in a signal transduction of changes in
conditions of bacterial microenvironment. Indole production
by E. coli cells, discovered in the early 20th century, has previously
been used as a diagnostic marker to differentiate E. coli
from other enteric bacteria. However, as it is now known, the
ability of bacteria to synthesize indole is widespread among
different species of microorganisms. It is produced by at least
27 genera of bacteria capable of synthesizing the enzyme tryptophanase
TnaA, which breaks down tryptophan to produce
indole, pyruvate and ammonium (Lee et al., 2007). Indole is
imported into the cell mainly through Mtr permease (Yanofsky
et al., 1991) and is exported from the cell using the multidrug
efflux pump AcrEF (Kawamura-Sato et al., 1999). In E. coli
cells, indole regulates such important cellular processes as
biofilm formation (Lee et al., 2007), persistence (Kwan et al.,
2015), the development of multidrug resistance (Hirakawa
et al., 2005), changes in plasmid stability (Chant, Summers,
2007), motility (Bansal et al., 2007), and the ability to survive
in mixed bacterial cultures (Chu et al., 2012).

Regulatory networks including the signaling molecules
cAMP, (p)ppGpp and indole closely interact in bacterial cells
to transduce intracellular or environmental signals for triggering
a cascade of biochemical reactions leading to changes
in cell gene expression profile and metabolism. One of the
regulators of indole synthesis is cAMP, which, as part of the
cAMP-CRP complex, positively regulates the transcription
of tryptophanase operon responsible for indole production
(Stewart, Yanofsky, 1985). We have previously shown that
indole formation in E. coli is a (p)ppGpp-dependent process
(Kashevarova et al., 2022). Decreased cAMP levels as a result
of degradation by phosphodiesterases reduce indole production,
increasing persistence (Kwan et al., 2015). At the same
time, the works of other researchers showed that exogenous addition of cAMP, with the participation of the cAMP-CRP
regulatory complex controlling the expression of RelA synthetase,
stimulated its expression and resulted in an increase in
(p)ppGpp production and persistence. Moreover, the activity
of the cAMP-CRP complex and the cAMP-CRP-controlled
expression of RelA increased upon glucose depletion in both
normal and persistent cells (Amato et al., 2013). Thus, regulatory
signals cAMP and indole (Kwan et al., 2015), along
with (p)ppGpp (Wood et al., 2013), are involved in multiple
persistence pathways.

The purpose of our study is to study the effect of (p)ppGpp
and indole on the formation of cAMP under conditions of
depletion of the carbon substrate glucose.

Strains and culture conditions. The objects of the study
were the E. coli BW25141 parent strain (WT, (p)ppGpp+)
(Datsenko, Wanner, 2000) and the BW25141ΔrelAΔspoT
mutant ((p)ppGpp0) (laboratory collection). Cultures stored
on Luria–Bertani (LB) agar (Sigma, USA) were cultivated
for 5 hours at 37 °C in tubes with 5 mL of LB broth (Sigma,
USA). Then, the cells were transferred to Erlenmeyer flasks
with minimal M9 medium (50 mL) containing 5.6 mM (0.1 %)
or 22.2 mM (0.4 %) glucose and cultivated at 120 rpm for
18 hours in a thermostated shaker GFL 1092 (GFL, Germany).
Overnight cultures were diluted in 50 mL of M9 medium with
appropriate concentrations of glucose to OD600 = 0.2. Tryptophan
(2 mM) (AppliChem, Germany) was added to some of
the flasks, keeping the others as controls, and then cultivated
under the same conditions for 168 hours. The optical density of
the cultures was measured by the absorbance value at 600 nm
on a UV-1650PC spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).

Gene engineering. The BW25141ΔrelAΔspoT deletion
mutant was constructed using the FLP/FRT site-specific recombination
system (Datsenko, Wanner, 2000).

Glucose content in the medium was determined by the
glucose oxidase method using a Glucose-Vital kit (Vital Development
Corporation, Russia). 5 μL of the samples were taken
from the exponentially growing cultures with a time interval
of one hour, and then once a day, and incubated with 1 mL
of the kit reagent at room temperature for 15 minutes. When
glucose is oxidized by glucose oxidase under the atmospheric
pressure, an equimolar amount of hydrogen peroxide is formed
that, in its turn, oxidizes chromogenic substrates by means of
peroxidase to form a colored product proportionally to glucose
concentration that was measured photometrically at 510 nm
on the UV-1650PC spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).

Determination of indole. The concentration of indole in
the medium was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography
(Kim et al., 2013), with minor modifications,
on an LC-20A chromatograph with an SPD-M20A spectrophotometric
detector (Shimadzu, Japan), Luna C18 column
(250×4.6 mm, 5 μm), SecurityGuard C18 pre-column (4×3 mm)
(Phenomenex, USA). To determine extracellular indole, the
samples were taken from the exponential phase cultures with
a time interval of 2 hours and once a day from the stationary
phase ones. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation. Supernatant
samples in a volume of 20 μL were analyzed at a mobile phase
flow rate of 1 mL/min (a mixture of acetonitrile (Kriochrome,
Russia) and acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio) and +25 °C with detection
at a wavelength of 280 nm. To calculate the indole content
in the sample, the external standard method was used based
on a previously constructed calibration curve.

Measurement of cAMP concentration. Quantitative determination
of intracellular cAMP concentration was carried
out by the competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA). 1.5 mL of the test culture was centrifuged at
12,000 rpm at +4 °C for 5 minutes. The pellet was resuspended
in 300 μL of 0.1N HCl, kept for 5 minutes at +95 °C, followed
by destruction of cells using a CPX-130 ultrasonic disintegrator
(Cole-Parmer, USA), using a probe with a diameter
of 6 mm (3 cycles for 30 seconds at an amplitude of 40 %).
Cell residues were precipitated by centrifugation for 15 minutes.
cAMP concentration was determined in the resulting
supernatant after neutralization with 2 M Na2CO3 according
to the manufacturer’s instruction (RayBio® cAMP Enzyme
Immunoassay). Experiments were carried out with at least
two independent cultures. The data obtained were normalized
to intracellular volume based on absolutely dry cell biomass

Statistical analysis. The results obtained were processed
statistically using the standard software package Statistica 6.0
(StatSoft Inc., USA). On the graphs, the means (at least three
experiments) and the standard deviations are represented.
The significance of differences was assessed using Student’s
t-test ( p ≤ 0.05).

In the present work, the dynamics of glucose depletion and
the formation of cAMP and indole in periodic cultures of
the E. coli BW25141 wild-type strain and the ΔrelAΔspoT
deletion mutant grown in M9 mineral medium with different
contents of initially added glucose (5.6 and 22.2 mM) were
studied. Overproduction of indole was induced by exogenous
addition of the amino acid tryptophan (2 mM), a precursor of
indole synthesis, in order to study its effect on the activity of
metabolic processes, in particular, the consumption rate of
carbon substrate (glucose) and cAMP formation.

When studying the glucose consumption in the strain periodic
cultures, it was found that at an initially low concentration
of glucose (5.6 mM), substrate depletion in the cells of
both strains studied occurred in the first hours of cultivation
(Fig. 1, a). Moreover, in the culture of the parental strain, glucose
was completely consumed after 3 hours of growth, while
(p)ppGpp absence in the cells of the ΔrelAΔspoT mutant led to
a delay in substrate consumption by 2 hours as compared to the
wild-type strain. At the same time, the presence of tryptophan
in the medium had no effect in both cases.

In the culture of parent strain with high initial glucose
concentration (22.2 mM), it was consumed for 12 hours
after the cells were inoculated to a fresh nutrient medium
(Fig. 1, b). The double ΔrelAΔspoT mutation, as well as at the
low glucose concentration (5.6 mM), led to a slowing down
of substrate utilization rate, so that glucose was consumed for
more than 24 hours. However, the addition of tryptophan to
the medium caused an acceleration of glucose consumption
for more than 4 hours in the parental strain and for 24 hours
in the (p)ppGpp0 mutant.

the (p)ppGpp0 one in the tryptophan-free medium ( р ≤ 0.05).

The onset of an increase in the initially low intracellular
level of cAMP coincided with the depletion of glucose in the
medium. Moreover, in cultures grown in the medium with 5.6 mM glucose, the increase in cAMP concentration occurred
earlier than in those grown in the medium with the addition
of 22.2 mM glucose (Fig. 2). At low glucose content in the
medium, the (p)ppGpp+ strain showed rapid depletion of
glucose for the first 1–3 hours, which was accompanied by
an active accumulation of cAMP during the same period (see
Fig. 2, a). However, the double ΔrelAΔspoT deletion led to
a sharper increase in cAMP levels starting at 5 hours, which
was not observed in the medium containing 22.2 mM glucose.
By the end of the observed period of the first day of cultivation
(9 hours of growth), higher values of cAMP accumulation
were demonstrated by the mutant at 5.6 mM glucose, which
was approximately 2 times higher than the cAMP level at
22.2 mM glucose.

In stationary cultures, a high concentration of initially
added glucose (22.2 mM) in the medium led to higher levels
of cAMP accumulation than at 5.6 mM glucose; however, in
the case of the deletion mutant, these differences were less
pronounced (Fig. 3).

The maximum values of cAMP accumulation in cells were
proportional to the concentration of added glucose. At the same
time, the (p)ppGpp0 knockout demonstrated a decrease in the
maximum level of cAMP compared to the WT strain that was
the most pronounced in the medium with 22.2 mM glucose.
Maximum accumulation of cAMP at 5.6 mM glucose content
in the mutant strain was achieved at 9 hours of cultivation with
a subsequent decrease, whereas in the (p)ppGpp+ parent, by
72 hours in the tryptophan-free medium and 24 hours in the
one supplemented with tryptophan (see Fig. 3, a). At high
glucose content (22.2 mM), the maximum cAMP values in
the WT strain were observed at 72 hours of growth both in
the tryptophan-free medium and in the presence of the indole
precursor (see Fig. 3, b). At the same time, the cAMP level in
the (p)ppGpp0 knockout changed slightly throughout the entire
cultivation period, especially in the medium supplemented
with tryptophan, and was up to 6 times lower as compared to
the WT strain. Thus, the absence of (p)ppGpp in the cells led
to a decrease in cAMP production.

We have previously shown that the effect of (p)ppGpp –
a stringent response signaling molecule – in the process of
indole production regulation by E. coli cells depends on the
glucose content in the cultural medium (Kashevarova et al.,
2022). Therefore, (p)ppGpp positively regulates the synthesis
of indole under the conditions of its spontaneous formation
at high content of glucose in the tryptophan-free medium.
However, this did not occur at low glucose concentration. At
exogenous addition of 2 mM tryptophan, (p)ppGpp-dependent
indole production was observed at both glucose concentrations
studied, with a more pronounced effect at the high carbon
substrate content. However, glucose limitation at the start of
cultivation (in the medium with 5.6 mM glucose) led to an
increase in the rate of indole accumulation and a reduction in
the time spent to reach its maximum values (Fig. 4).

(р ≤ 0.05).

When studying the effect of indole overproduction on the
synthesis of cAMP depending on the carbon substrate content,
it was found that the addition of the amino acid tryptophan,
which caused the accumulation of indole in the medium to
2.2–2.9 mM (see Fig. 4, c, d ), did not have a significant effect
on intracellular cAMP concentration in both parent and deletion
strains at the studied glucose concentrations. However,
there was an exception: at high glucose content, the (p)ppGpp+
strain demonstrated a decrease in the cAMP levels of up to
4 times compared to the tryptophan-free control in response
to tryptophan addition (Fig. 5).

with 2 mM tryptophan and the same one grown in the tryptophanfree
medium ( р ≤ 0.05).

Bacteria, exposed to various stress factors such as starvation,
temperature, acid, oxidative stress, etc., have developed effective
stress response mechanisms for cell adaptation to unfavorable
conditions. Stress responses are induced by signaling
molecules that trigger a chain of reactions leading to changes
in gene expression and restructuring of cell metabolism, which
allows bacteria to survive adverse effects.

In the present work, the mutual influence of the signaling
molecules (p)ppGpp, cAMP, and indole upon depletion of
glucose in the culture medium was studied. Glucose is the
preferred source of carbon and energy for E. coli cells, which
have developed a complex regulatory network that coordinates
gene expression, transport, and enzyme activity in response to
the presence of this substrate (Gutierrez-Ríos et al., 2007). Carbon
starvation induces a general stress response regulated by
catabolic repression and the (p)ppGpp-mediated stringent response.
In E. coli, genes controlled by the catabolic repression
regulator protein (CRP) are RelA-dependent, indicating that
(p)ppGpp is a global regulator of carbon starvation (Traxler et
al., 2006) and demonstrating the interaction between catabolic
repression and stringent response mechanisms. A recent study
using fluorescence spectroscopy showed that (p)ppGpp is able
to bind to the CRP protein with high affinity, and molecular
docking results suggested that (p)ppGpp may negatively
regulate the activity of this protein. Thus, CRP-controlled
gene expression is modulated by (p)ppGpp as a result of its
binding to CRP under starvation stress (Duysak et al., 2021).

In bacterial cells, intracellular levels of cAMP are dependent
on many factors and, first of all, are determined by the
ratio of the enzymes adenylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase
activities. The cAMP signaling molecule is a part of the
cAMP-CRP complex, which, on the one hand, is controlled by
carbohydrates of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase
system (Deutscher et al., 2006), and, on the other, regulates
the catabolite repression of carbon (Botsford, Harman, 1992).
The presence of glucose in the growth medium suppresses
the expression of enzymes that catalyze the metabolism
of other carbon sources, reducing the levels of both CRP
protein and cAMP (Ishizuka et al., 1994). In E. coli, cellular
cAMP levels are inversely proportional to the concentration
of carbon source, resulting in low cAMP content in the presence
of an easily metabolized carbon source (glucose). In
addition to carbon catabolism, cAMP-CRP regulon controls
important cellular functions associated with stress response,
cell division, and amino acid metabolism, including the tnaA
(tryptophanase) gene, which is responsible for the production of one of the E. coli metabolites, indole, from the amino acid
tryptophan (Isaacs et al., 1994).

In this work, the dependence of the dynamics of cAMP
and indole synthesis on the presence of (p)ppGpp and glucose
contents in the growth medium has been studied. In the
experiments, two glucose concentrations of 5.6 and 22.2 mM
have been used, which we have designated as low and high
glucose contents, respectively. When glucose is depleted in
the medium with tryptophan, the metabolism of bacterial cells
switches to the utilization of this substrate, which E. coli cells
are able to use as the only source of carbon and nitrogen due
to the action of the inducible enzyme tryptophanase, which
breaks down tryptophan to form indole (Yanofsky et al., 1991).

Our studies have shown that the absence of (p)ppGpp in
cells reduced their ability to utilize glucose, which was the
most pronounced at high glucose content in the growth medium
(22.2 mM). However, an acceleration of glucose consumption
from the medium supplemented with tryptophan
was demonstrated (see Fig. 1). The ability of bacterial cells
to produce (p)ppGpp plays an important role in glucose metabolism,
which has been shown for both Gram-positive and
Gram-negative bacteria (Oh et al., 2015). In the process of
bacterial adaptation to glucose starvation, in addition to
stringent
response, in which cell growth and the synthesis of
macromolecules are inhibited, an expanded adaptive response
is formed, including inhibition of glycolysis and metabolic
transitions mediated through the mechanism of catabolite
repression (Zhang et al., 2016). Our experiments have shown
that the depletion of glucose in the medium is accompanied
by an increase in the initially low intracellular cAMP content.
The maximum level of cAMP accumulation in bacterial cells
has been shown to be proportional to the concentration of
the initially added substrate. At low glucose concentration
(5.6 mM), an increase in the cAMP level occurred earlier than at 22.2 mM glucose (see Fig. 2). At 5.6 mM glucose,
the maximum values of intracellular cAMP concentration
over a 168-hour period of observation were achieved already
at the first day of cultivation in the (p)ppGpp0 mutant and at
24 hours in the parental strain with the addition of tryptophan.
At the same time, in the tryptophan-free culture of the
(p)ppGpp+ strain, the maximum cAMP level was observed
at 72 hours of cultivation (see Fig. 3, a), as well as under the
conditions of 22.2 mM glucose addition to the medium (see
Fig. 3, b). At initially high glucose content, the level of cAMP
was higher in the parental strain as compared to the deletion
mutant both in the tryptophan-free medium and in its presence
(see Fig. 3, b). Thus, the absence of (p)ppGpp in cells
led to a decrease in cAMP formation. These data allow us to
assume that the process of cAMP synthesis in E. coli cells is
positively regulated by (p)ppGpp.

The second messenger (p)ppGpp is able to modulate gene
expression in response to various stress factors in different
bacterial species (Irving, Corrigan, 2018). It is a key regulator
of stringent response, one of the most important protective
mechanisms in bacterial adaptation induced primarily by
starvation stress (Traxler et al., 2006, 2008). In Gram-negative
bacteria, (p)ppGpp regulates transcription initiation by directly
binding to RNA polymerase. In this case, the stimulatory or
inhibitory effects of (p)ppGpp on transcription depend on the
composition of the discriminatory sequences (AT- or GC-rich)
(Sanchez-Vazquez et al., 2019). In addition, (p)ppGpp can
directly bind to proteins and thereby change their catalytic
activity. Thus, in the work (Ro et al., 2021), it was shown that
(p)ppGpp promotes acetylation of the CRP protein, which,
as a part of the cAMP-CRP complex, plays a key role in
the regulation of gene expression in E. coli. However, there
are no significant differences between the parent strain and
the mutant one with a deletion of one of two E. coli ΔrelA
alarmone synthetases in either the levels of cAMP content or
the expression of adenylate cyclase cyaA responsible for the
production of cAMP.

Our results have demonstrated the effect of (p)ppGpp on the
level of cAMP content, which is displayed in an increase in the
concentration of cAMP in the (p)ppGpp+ strain as compared
to the mutant strain with the double ΔrelAΔspoT deletion by
2.8 and 6 times at 5.6 and 22.2 mM glucose content, respectively,
at 72 hours of growth in the tryptophan-free medium
(see Fig. 3). A similar effect of (p)ppGpp on the level of cAMP
was also observed under excessive accumulation of indole,
but only at high initial glucose concentration in the medium
(22.2 mM) (see Fig. 3, b). However, the difference in cAMP
content between the WT strain and the knockout one disappeared
under glucose limitation (5.6 mM, see Fig. 3, a). The
lack of (p)ppGpp effect on cAMP levels (Ro et al., 2021) could
probably be explained by the activity of SpoT synthetase leading
to the accumulation of (p)ppGpp, while in our experiments
the complete absence of stringent response signaling molecule
should be ensured by the double ΔrelAΔspoT deletion. Interestingly,
the presence of (p)ppGpp in cells accelerated the onset of
cAMP synthesis under the conditions of glucose limitation (at
the initial content of 5.6 mM glucose in the growth medium),
which was observed after 3 hours of growth by a statistically
significant 4-fold increase in intracellular cAMP concentration
in the (p)ppGpp+ strain as compared to the ΔrelAΔspoT
mutant in the tryptophan-free medium. However, at the next
two sampling points – 5 and 9 hours of cultivation – the
(p) ppGpp0
knockout was superior compared to the parent
strain in the level of cAMP production (see Fig. 4, b), which
was also displayed under tryptophan supplementation (see
Fig. 4, d ).

The present study shows that (p)ppGpp is involved in the
regulation of cAMP production, as well as in indole biosynthesis.
It is known that the tnaCAB operon responsible for
indole biosynthesis is positively regulated by the cAMPCRP-
dependent mechanism of catabolite repression and is
induced at the transcriptional level upon depletion of carbohydrates
and cell transition to the stationary phase (Stewart,
Yanofsky, 1985). This explains the observed increase in the
cAMP content to levels of 1.8 and 6 ng/μL during cell growth
in the tryptophan-free medium at 5.6 and 22.2 mM glucose,
respectively (see Fig. 3). This was accompanied by a significant
increase in indole formation of up to 10 times at high
glucose content in the medium, which is typical only for the
parent strain, but not for the mutant one (see Fig. 4, a). Based
on these data, we concluded that the alarmone (p)ppGpp
along with catabolite repression can positively regulate the
process of indole formation. As it follows from Fig. 4, a, b,
the intracellular concentration of cAMP was decreased by 6
and 3 times at 22.2 and 5.6 mM glucose, respectively, in the
ΔrelAΔspoT mutant as compared to the (p)ppGpp+ strain
under growth in the tryptophan-free medium. This indicates
a positive role of (p)ppGpp in the regulation of both cAMP
synthesis and indole production. Under the addition of tryptophan,
both the parent and the mutant strains have demonstrated
high indole production at both glucose concentrations studied
(see Fig. 4, c, d ). The increase in indole formation occurred
earlier in the medium with low glucose content compared to
the one with 22.2 mM glucose, which may be due to the earlier
formation of cAMP in the cells. At the same time, the mutant
has also demonstrated a time delay in indole accumulation,
which was more pronounced at high initial glucose content
in the medium (see Fig. 4, c). Thus, in E. coli cells, indole
production has been shown to be under the positive control
of the second messengers (p)ppGpp and cAMP under glucose
depletion during batch culture growth.

As shown by our experiments, the cAMP level in E. coli
cells depends to some extent on the indole content in the
medium. The presence of tryptophan, a substrate for indole
synthesis, led to overproduction of indole in the cultures of
both the WT strain and the mutant. However, a decrease in
cAMP concentration was observed only in the parent strain,
which was more pronounced at 22.2 mM glucose (see Fig. 5).
However, high indole production in knockout cell culture did
not produce a significant effect on the cAMP level.

Therefore, the results obtained in this work demonstrate
that the absence of the alarmone (p)ppGpp in E. coli cells led
to a decrease in cAMP formation and deceleration in glucose
metabolism. An increase in the level of cAMP in response
to glucose depletion was accompanied by the synthesis of
indole with a pronounced decrease in its accumulation in
the (p)ppGpp0 mutant as compared to the parent strain. This
was observed in both the tryptophan-free medium and at the
tryptophan addition. In cells of the (p)ppGpp+ strain growing
in the tryptophan-free medium at a low rate of spontaneous indole formation, its synthesis was significantly increased in
response to an increase in the level of cAMP upon depletion of
glucose. This phenomenon was not observed in the (p)ppGpp0
mutant that was characterized by a reduced accumulation of
cAMP. These data indicate a positive role of (p)ppGpp in the
regulation of indole formation, along with the cAMP-mediated
catabolic repression. At the addition of tryptophan, both the
parental and (p)ppGpp0 strains have demonstrated high indole
production, which was accompanied by a decrease in the level
of cAMP accumulation in comparison with the tryptophanfree
control and was the most pronounced in the (p)ppGpp+
strain at 22.2 mM glucose. Thus, at glucose depletion, the
alarmone (p)ppGpp positively regulates the accumulation
of cAMP and indole, and the latter, in its turn, reduces the
formation of cAMP

The survival of bacteria in continuously changing environmental
conditions is due to a complex, formed during the
evolutionary process, system of numerous interacting regulatory
networks that control the diverse physiological functions
of bacteria under various stress factors. This work studies the
interaction of signaling molecules cAMP, (p)ppGpp, and indole,
under the conditions of substrate limitation. The results
obtained demonstrate that (p)ppGpp functions as a positive
regulator of such processes as glucose metabolism, cAMP
synthesis, and indole production. The intracellular level of
cAMP accumulation depends on both glucose availability in
the medium and the stringent response alarmone (p)ppGpp.
The absence of (p)ppGpp in cells reduces their ability to
produce indole under the conditions of a low rate of its spontaneous
formation during cell growth in the tryptophan-free
medium and decelerates the rate of indole accumulation in the
medium supplemented with tryptophan. Indole biosynthesis
in E. coli is positively regulated by the signaling molecules
(p)ppGpp and cAMP at substrate limitation. This gives us
reason to conclude that (p)ppGpp-dependent indole production
is mediated through changes in the level of cAMP in
cells. The results obtained demonstrate the modulatory effect
of (p) ppGpp
on the expression of genes of the tryptophanase
operon regulated by means of the cAMP-CRP-dependent
mechanism of catabolite repression, the removal of which is
induced in response to glucose depletion.
