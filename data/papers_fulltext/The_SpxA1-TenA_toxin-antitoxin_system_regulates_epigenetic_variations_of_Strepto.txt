This notion is based on multiple lines of experimental evidence in this work. In particular, the vast majority of the protein hits in the TenA affinity pull-down were associated with protein synthesis. In the context of specific binding between TenA and RimM (see below), this finding suggested that TenA exerts its regulatory role by directly interacting with RimM. Alternatively, TenA may also indirectly interact with other ribosomal proteins via RimM as a molecular bridge. Moreover, our bacterial two-hybrid assay revealed binding interactions between TenA and RimM, which was supported by the highly probable complex of the two proteins predicted by AlphaFold3. Since RimM is crucial for the maturation of the small ribosomal subunit [

PPATHOGENS-D-24-01936The SpxA1-TenA Toxin-Antitoxin System Regulates Epigenetic Variations of Streptococcus pneumoniae by Targeting Protein SynthesisPLOS Pathogens Dear Jing-Ren, Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS Pathogens. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS Pathogens's publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process. In addition to the comments of reviewers, please consider addressing the following I (JL) noted: In Fig. S4A and B. the ∆spxA2 exhibits increased spxA1 transcription and also a modest but significant decrease in hsdS

Please use this section to discuss strengths/weaknesses of study, novelty/significance, general execution and scholarship.

Reviewer #1: The present study demonstrates that epigenetic traits of the pathogen Streptococcus pnumoniae are controlled by a novel Toxin-Antitoxin system. It is a new and important study in the complex biology of this bacterium, and represents an important step forward to our understanding of bacterial virulence.

Reviewer #2: This a highly significant and novel study with many strengths and only minor grammatical weaknesses. The study is really a tour de force of investigation into how phase variation in pneumococcus is regulated. It could easily have been broken up into two or three smaller papers, but instead, the authors present it as one coherent, rigorous study.

Reviewer #3: Wang and Li et al identified a new T/A system, consisting of SpxAI and TenA, in Streptococcus pneumoniae. Specifically, they found that TenA represses RimM maturation and ComX levels. Additionally, this system controls phases of the epigenome. The findings are rigorous, novel, and explained extremely well which is critical for a journal with a broad audience.

**********



Please use this section to detail the key new experiments or modifications of existing experiments that should be

Generally, there should be no more than 3 such required experiments or major modifications for a "Major Revision" recommendation. If more than 3 experiments are necessary to validate the study conclusions, then you are encouraged to recommend "Reject".

Reviewer #1: The mansuscript is well presented and, in my opinion, does not need further experiments.

Reviewer #2: None

Reviewer #3: 1. Major comment: In lines 256-258 the authors state their findings confirm that TenA is transcriptionally repressed by SpxA1. How do the authors think this is happening? Is this just because the proteins are on the same transcript? To explore this finding, it would be useful for the authors to show a knock in of spxAI in a neutral locus represses tenA transcription levels (see Fig4B). Regardless of this experiment, Fig4B needs a spXAI complemented control.

**********



Please use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity.

Reviewer #1: The paper is very well rittent, the Figures are very clear.

Reviewer #2: 1. Line 469: The journal may not allow “Data not shown”. If you have the data, it should go in supplement. Alternatively, delete this sentence.

2. Line 490: With respect to the sentence “In particular, the vast majority of the protein hits in the TenA affinity pull-down were associated with protein synthesis.”, is it possible that TenA actually only binds RimM, but RimM is bound to these other ribosomal proteins?

3. Table 1. Is a p value of zero a legitimate value to report? I believe it is better to report p < [smallest representable value].

4. Delete “interestingly” here and elsewhere (line 295). That is opinion and is not very scientific.

5. Line 121: Change “insertion sequence” to “inserted sequence”. An insertion sequence is technically a transposable element in bacteria.

6. Line 148: Delete “finally”.

7. Lines 158, 162, 341, 452: Why is “via” italicized? It shouldn’t be.

8. Line 239: I believe you want to delete “as SpxA1” at the end of the sentence. Otherwise, rewrite the sentence to be more precise.

9. Line 256: “have confirmed” is a little too strong. I suggest changing to “suggest” or “indicate”.

10. Line 264: Change “trial” to “experiment”.

11. Line 304: Start sentence with “This”.

12. Line 319: Change “mostly” to “most”.

13. Line 346: Change “persisted robustly” to “abundant”, or something more clear.

14. Line 360: Change “TIRGR4” to “TIGR4”.

15. Line 378: Strain not “stain”.

16. In the RNA isolation and sequencing section in Materials and Methods, we rRNA removed? This wasn’t mentioned. If not, then fine.

17. Line 657: Delete “and vitality”.

Reviewer #3: Minor comments:

a. Fig1A: Is the arrow in the bottom right panel supposed to be blue? The colony looks opaque.

b. What does the red arrow mean in Fig2B.

c. Fig5E lacks a Y axis label
