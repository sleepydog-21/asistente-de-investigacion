The resistance at conditions that would be lethal for vegetative cells is mainly due to the peculiar structure of the spore. The spore cytoplasm (core) is characterized by a low water content and is surrounded by various protective layers, a peptidoglycan-like cortex, a multilayered coat, and the outermost crust (

Previous studies have shown that mutant strains lacking the

In this context, we show that when the carbohydrates synthesized by the SpsA-L enzymes are not produced, hydrophobic molecules are exposed on the surface of the mutant spore, which, as a consequence, become hydrophobic and form aggregates in aqueous environments. The triterpenoid curcumene (

Spore resistance was tested as previously reported by (

For heat resistance, heat-treated (80°C for 10 min) and untreated spores were serially diluted in PBS 1× buffer and plated on TY agar. For ultraviolet (UV) light resistance, spores were suspended in a sterile glass 10 cm diameter petri dish and irradiated with a UV lamp (700 erg/mm

Also, in this case, after treatment with MeOH and ultrasonication, the spores were suspended in water, and the assay was performed as reported above. Three independent experiments replicated trice, which were performed with spores prepared independently.

Lipid extraction from spores for GC-MS analysis was performed following the Folch method with some modifications (

The composition and content of bound and free fatty acids in the samples (200 µL lipid extract evaporated into dryness) were determined after transesterification with 500 µL of 0.5 N sodium methoxide (Sigma-Aldrich) and boiling at 45°C for 5 min (

Free polar groups, like hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, were trimethylsilylated to improve their volatility and stability (
