Biofilm formation was measured using a Biofilm Formation Assay Kit (Dojindo, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 180 µL of microbial cell suspension in biofilm-inducing minimal salts glycerol glutamate (MSgg) medium (

Genomic DNA libraries were prepared for each isolate using the NEBNext DNA Library Prep Master Mix Set for Illumina (New England Biolabs (NEB), Ipswich, MA, USA) and NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (Index Primers Set one and Set 2; NEB) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries were then used for 2 × 151, 250, or 300 bp paired-end sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with a MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 (300 cycles, 500 cycles) or v3 (600 cycles). After filtering low-quality reads and quality trimming using CLC Genomics Workbench 20 (Qiagen) with default parameters, standard settings were used to conduct
