The AAP‐ILEP system thus provides a competitive advantage in nutrient‐limited and/or closed environments by enabling efficient storage and utilization of BCAA. These findings will highlight the unique metabolic adaptations of lactic acid bacteria and provide insights into the ecological strategies employed by lactic acid bacteria in competitive microbial ecosystems.
