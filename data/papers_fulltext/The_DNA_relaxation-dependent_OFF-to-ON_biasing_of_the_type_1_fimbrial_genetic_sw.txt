Plasmid DNA was isolated using Qiagen Midi columns or Wizard mini prep columns (Promega). Specific DNA fragments were isolated using an agarose gel extraction kit (Roche Applied Science). Restriction enzyme digests were carried out using enzymes purchased from New England Biolabs by following the manufacturer’s recommended procedure. Plasmid DNA was sequenced using a T7 sequencing system (USB). Plasmid pSGS501 was used as the template with oligonucleotide COL69 as the sequencing primer (
