Increased antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in

Resistance–nodulation–cell division (RND) efflux systems, such as CmeABC, enhance resistance to bile salts and synergize with other resistance determinants, contributing to increased resistance to various antimicrobials (

Given the widespread resistance across antibiotic classes (

Human

Poultry fecal samples were obtained from two distinct sampling events. The first one (study D) took place between August and December 2019. Households in Santa Clara de Nanay (a periurban community in Iquitos, Loreto, Peru) were surveyed for the presence of chickens by local field workers. Specifically, households that had chickens in their backyards (“chacras”) or inside the living domain of the household were identified by asking the household owner. Of these, a random sample was selected, and between three and five fecal samples from backyard poultry (crossbreed,

Human fecal samples from the first cohort, as well as poultry fecal samples, were cultured using

Our findings hint at a broader, widespread acquisition of MDR elements that can compromise oral antibiotic treatment, particularly in low-resource settings where there is the greatest need for effective antimicrobial treatment. We also highlight the need to incorporate more subtle gene mutations into

While our work provides a snapshot of the current spread of AMR in Peru, improved global sampling efforts help provide context to our findings. Improved genomic epidemiology and pathogen surveillance from a broader range of countries and continents will provide a greater understanding of the evolution and spread of AMR in
