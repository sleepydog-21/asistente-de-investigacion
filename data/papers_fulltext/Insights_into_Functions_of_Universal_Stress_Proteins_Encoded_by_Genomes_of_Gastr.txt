We have previously investigated the functions of genes that encode the universal stress protein (Usp) domain (Pfam protein family: pfam00582 or PF00582) in bacteria and eukaryotes [

Genomic context is “information gleaned from the genes surrounding a gene of interest in the chromosome” [

Datasets retrieved from IMG/M by providing a list of gene identifiers (Gene ID) were the source of transcription direction (inferred from genome strand); base pair distances between the USP gene and adjacent gene; and protein family (pfam domain) annotation for the genes adjacent to the USP gene. We constructed a three-digit binary number to represent the genome strand annotation (+ or −) relative of the upstream and downstream genes to the direction of the USP gene. We assigned “1” to USP, and if the adjacent gene to the USP gene is in the same transcription direction, “1” represents the transcription direction relative to the USP gene, otherwise “0” is assigned. The possible three-digit representations and transcription direction using greater than and less than symbols are “010” (< > <), “011” (< > >), “110” (> > <), and “111” (> > >). Therefore, “111” represents that the USP gene and the two adjacent genes are in the same direction; while “010” represents that the USP gene is in a different transcription direction relative to the two adjacent genes. This representation could identify USP genes that have a different gene adjacency pattern from the majority of genomes from the same species. We designed visual analytics worksheets to integrate and group the USP genes according to gene transcription direction, location coordinates (start and stop positions), and pfam annotations of adjacent genes.

We searched scholarly literature databases such as Google Scholar and PubMed for studies on RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq), transcriptome profiling, and protein–protein interaction maps of

The NCBI Batch Web Conserved Domain (CD) Search Tool predicted functional sites for 1030 (98%) of the 1045 universal stress protein sequences submitted. The output of the search tool includes coordinates (e.g., G6, I7, S8, V36, I105, G106, S108, E109, S119, H120, and Q121), the complete size of the ligand (e.g., 12), and the mapped size (e.g., 11). We constructed an Amino Acid Pattern by combining the amino acids symbols (e.g., GISVIGSESHQ) and the Amino Acid Position Pattern by combining numeric position of the amino acid residue separated by an underscore (e.g., 6_7_8_36_105_106_108_109_119_120_121). In the third position of the USP functional sites patterns, there were three types of residues: aspartate (D), histidine (H) and serine (S). The residue in the third position was selected because changes in the amino acid affected ATP-binding [

The clustering of the 1045 USP sequences into 183 clusters also allowed us to determine the count of USP sequence clusters per group of strains (strain group). A strain group has strains, which share features such as a genome sequencing project or publication. For example,

Genomic context searches and analysis identified USP genes of gastric and enterohepatic helicobacters that are in adjacency or operonic arrangements with genes for oxidative stress response proteins (ATP-dependent proteases: ClpS and ClpA); and DNA uptake proteins (natural competence for transformation proteins: ComB6, ComB7, ComB8, ComB9, ComB10, ComBE, and conjugative transfer signal peptidase: TraF). The ComB6, ComB7, ComB9, and ComB10 are necessary for the first step of DNA uptake in

The functional annotations and transcription direction of genes adjacent to USP genes have provided valuable insights into potential functional associations and operon arrangements. Noteworthy is the finding that genes involved in posttranslational modification, protein turnover, and chaperone functions are adjacent to USP genes exclusively in gastric helicobacters. The USPs in these species may function in protein synthesis quality control and stress response mechanisms specific to the gastric environment [
