In Thailand, an analysis of the assessed health burden due to antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria from 2009 to 2010 showed that at least 90,000 patients per year were hospitalized with antimicrobial-resistant bacterial infections; approximately one-third of them died [

Our recent report indicated that

Sixty-eight

In order to characterize these

Based on AMR patterns, MDR, last-line drug (COL and IMI) resistance, and ESBL-producing isolates were found in our collection. To investigate the genotypic characteristics of these isolates, genomic data were annotated and predicted for AMR genes using the ResFinder and NDARO databases (

The beta-lactam (amoxicillin–clavulanic acid, AMC, AMP, CAZ, CTX, or IMI) resistance phenotype comprised the majority of resistance patterns (n = 44/68, 64.71%). Seven ESBL-producing strains (8.82%) contained beta-lactamase (

In our collection, we found only one strain with carbapenem resistance, CM24E, which harbored

Among the genomic data from 68

To analyze the correlation between genotype (AMR and virulence) and phenotype (AMR), the data on AMR patterns obtained from disk diffusion and microdilution (0 = sensitive, 1 = intermediate resistance or resistance) and genotypic data (0 = absence, 1 = presence) were analyzed using Pearson correlation. We found no correlations between phenotypes and genotypes among all strains of

The presence of

Based on whole genome sequencing, we found that the majority of isolated strains belong to Clermont type A (51.47%), followed by B1 (41.18%), C (2.94%), D (2.94%), and B2 (1.47%). Clermont types A, B1, and C are major clusters of commensal nonpathogenic

Based on AMR gene prediction, we found that six strains harbored the
