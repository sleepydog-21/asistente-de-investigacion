To explore the sensitivity of the dCas13a system to mismatches in the context of bacterial RNA repression, we introduced mismatched crRNA spacers targeting the same RNA sequence. Specifically, we systematically mutated complementary bases at intervals of every three base pairs, resulting in the creation of 10 distinct crRNA spacers (Figure

In the context of our study, we reprogrammed the CRISPR–dCas13a system to interact with SgrS. This intervention reduces the availability of free SgrS within the cell, thereby diminishing the formation of SgrS–Hfq complexes responsible for repressing PtsG mRNA (Figure

When using the group of sgrS1–sgrS5 crRNAs, the dCas13a ribonucleoproteins exhibited slight growth inhibition, with reductions ranging from 4.83% to 18.27%, compared with the non-targeted CRISPR–dCas13a (NT). Conversely, the crRNAs sgrS8, sgrS9 or sgrS10 in the CRISPR–dCas13a system did not induce a significant growth inhibition like sgrS6 or sgrS7 crRNAs within the same group. However, dCas13a ribonucleoproteins with either sgrS6 or sgrS7 crRNA from the other group demonstrated more pronounced growth inhibition, resulting in reductions of 29.9–30.2% compared with the NT. In the absence of αMG, dCas13a with sgrS7 crRNA did not lead to growth inhibition and exhibited a similar level to the NT. This outcome suggests that CRISPR–dCas13a with sgrS7 crRNA specifically regulates SgrS.

Regarding spacer design, the spacers sgrS6 or sgrS7 cover 100% of the PtsG mRNA-binding site region. This result emphasizes the importance of blocking the PtsG mRNA-binding site through dCas13a reprogramming to prevent the functional role of SgrS. Consequently, we have learned that a key design principle for sRNA targeting spacers is to reprogram the RNA sequence that interacts with the target mRNA site while preserving the Hfq-binding site.

To elucidate the transcriptional-level underpinnings of the phenotypic response, we conducted direct measurements of the relative mRNA expression levels of

To assess the sequence-specific impact of the CRISPR–dCas13a system, we embarked on an exploration of the spacer sequence's specificity within the crRNA, particularly its binding to the target RNA.

To circumvent the uncertainties associated with using CRISPR–dCas9 on GadY expression, an alternative approach involves utilizing an sgRNA to target the promoter region of the GadXW operon, effectively repressing the expression of the entire gene cluster. Indeed, this dCas9 system successfully suppresses the function of acid tolerance conferred by GadXW (Figure

Building on the foundation of robust gene repression achievable with the CRISPR–dCas13a system, we embarked on the challenge of achieving specific gene repression within a polycistronic gene operon, a feat not easily accomplished using the CRISPR–dCas9 system, which tends to repress all genes within operons. To illustrate this capability, we selected the

Among the strains in which sRNAs led to improved statistically significant lycopene production in the context of metabolic engineering, we singled out the top-ranked 12 strains. To further validate these production results, we designed an additional crRNA with a single nucleotide difference in the 5′-end direction of the spacer, aiming to target the same sRNA independently. Interestingly, there was no significant fold change observed between the two crRNAs (Figure

It is worth noting that for the other targets requiring overexpression, precise gene expression control may be essential when implementing a metabolic engineering approach, particularly given that sRNA regulation predominantly occurs during the stationary phase. Additionally, gaining insights into the enigmatic regulatory mechanisms of the target sRNAs is crucial to effectively harness our findings for metabolic engineering applications.

While CRISPR–dCas13a has the potential to repress target sRNAs by designing spacers within the core functional region, the structural complexity of the target sRNA can limit its applicability due to the uncertainty of RNA base pairing between the target sRNA and dCas13a–crRNA protein. To address this challenge, we employed RNA structural prediction to generate potential secondary structures of target sRNAs for selecting optimal spacer regions (
