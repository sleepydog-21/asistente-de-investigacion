Sucrose, the main compound in table sugar, is widely used and primarily produced from sugar beet and sugar cane [

The level of cAMP can be modulated by Crr, which is the glucose-specific EIIA (EIIA

In this study, we examined the impact of sucrose on

After the bacterial lysate was analyzed by 12 % SDS polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE), the total bacterial proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The observation of bacterial proteins, MrkA and ManA, by Western blotting followed the method in the previous study [

The transcriptional levels of

The results of biofilm quantification, bacterial growth, and quantification of the band intensity from Western blotting were expressed as the mean±standard deviation (SD) from three independent tests. The data were analyzed using a student's t-test, and the significant difference of the data was considered at

To study the effects of sucrose on biofilm formation by

Since the gene

Since these results indicate that

Since we observed that sucrose reduces the biofilm of

Type 3 fimbriae facilitate bacterial attachment to surfaces. To investigate the effect of sucrose on the type 3 fimbrial shaft protein, MrkA, Western blotting and RT-qPCR was performed. The results showed that the amount of MrkA protein and

It has been reported that ScrA relies on the Crr protein, also known as Enzyme IIIA, for the transportation and phosphorylation of sucrose. However, this was demonstrated using an

To investigate the impact of Crr on biofilm formation by

Crr positively modulates the activity of adenylyl cyclase (AC), which elevates the intracellular cAMP level in

The effects of capsular polysaccharide (CPS) on the biofilm of

Previous studies have shown that a 1 % concentration of sucrose had no effect on some bacteria (staphylococci,

The spatial interaction between ScrA and the upstream DNA region of

In addition to ScrA (sucrose-specific EIIBC), Crr also serves as the cognate EIIA of PtsG, which is the glucose-specific EIIBC in Enterobacteriaceae [
