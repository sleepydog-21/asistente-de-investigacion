The main system for inactivation of DnaA is called RIDA (regulatory inactivation of DnaA), in which DnaA-bound ATP is catalytically hydrolyzed by the complex of the AAA+ Hda protein and the DNA-loaded form of the clamp (β subunit) of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme in a manner coupled with DNA replication (
