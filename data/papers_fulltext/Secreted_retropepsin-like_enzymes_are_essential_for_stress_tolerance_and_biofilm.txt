Proteases, enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, have been established as potent drug targets (

All aspartic peptidases are endopeptidases that use an aspartate dyad and an activated water molecule to hydrolyze the peptide bond (

In

Here we present the structural and functional characterization of three related, previously uncharacterized aspartic peptidases in

A BLASTp search of the

Analysis of the phylogenetic distribution of the Rlo proteins across the tree of life revealed that RloA aspartic peptidases, classified as zinc proteases in Pfam (

To investigate the evolutionary relationship between RimB and the RloA aspartic peptidases, we analyzed the taxonomic distribution of the RimB-RimK and RloA-RloB-RloC systems. This analysis revealed that the RimB-RimK system (

In order to functionally characterize the biological roles of RloA proteases, we used allelic exchange in

We next aimed to rescue the lack of growth of ∆

To test whether the protease activity of RloA proteins is required for their roles in osmotic stress tolerance, we introduced an alanine mutation in the critical aspartic acid residue in the catalytic site of plasmid-encoded

To better characterize the molecular features of RloA proteins, we determined the crystal structures of two representative orthologs,

A search against experimentally determined structures using the Foldseek server (

A prominent feature from the structural comparison of RloA proteases with viral retropepsins is that the disordered regions in the RloA

RloA orthologs also differ from retroviral pepsins in the topology of their ‘β-sheet platform’ dimer interfaces. In HIV protease, the β-sheet platform comprises four interdigitated strands from the amino and carboxyl termini of the two protein protomers in the dimer (

The active sites of viral and bacterial retropepsins have a similar topology, particularly regarding the placement of the conserved DTG motif that harbors the catalytic aspartate dyad. This observation suggests that a conserved reaction chemistry unifies these proteases (

In conclusion, the structural analysis of RloA proteases shows many common features with viral retropepsins, but also differences that might be relevant to define the accessibility of the active site and the substrate specificity of RloA proteases, such as variations in the length of the flexible flaps, the structure of the β-sheet platform, and the charge surrounding the active site channel.

RimB, the cytoplasmic RloA homolog, has been shown to process polyglutamate residues (

To test the structural prediction that polyglutamate could serve as a substrate for RloA orthologs, we used a reconstituted

To further define the specificity of RloA proteases for polyglutamate substrates, we designed a fluorescent reporter that contained sequences with increasing number of glutamate residues (2E to 10E), flanked by a N-terminal SUMO and a C-terminal monomeric superfolder GFP (msfGFP) domain (

In order to identify putative RloA

Given the sequence and structural similarities between RloA proteases and RimB, as well as the fact that RloA can proteolytically cleave RimB substrates

We next asked whether deletion of the RloA proteases has other consequences for bacterial physiology, including effects on clinically relevant

To test whether RloA proteases influence antibiotic resistance, we first analyzed our PA14 wild type and ∆

The ability of bacteria to tolerate osmotic changes in the environment partially depends on the integrity of their cell wall, a peptidoglycan structure that encases the cytoplasmic membrane, providing strength to resist turgor pressure and regulating bacterial shape (

Because genes co-transcribed as part of an operon often have related functional roles (

Our structural and phenotypic characterization of aspartic proteases in

We show that RloA proteins have structural features characteristic of retroviral pepsins, including a C2 pseudosymmetric dimeric arrangement, the location of the active site at the dimer interface, and the presence of flexible flaps covering the substrate channel. Studies on HIV protease have determined that substrate recognition by retroviral pepsins is dictated by the fitting of the substrate shape and volume at the substrate cavity, rather than by the recognition of a specific amino acid sequence in the substrate (

The three RloA proteases described in our study are related to RimB, the only aspartic protease previously characterized in

While additional experiments will be required to unravel how the protein activities of RloA, RloB and RloC ultimately influence the physiological processes controlled by these enzymes, our findings identify RloA proteins as a novel class of secreted bacterial retropepsin-like enzymes and uncover important roles for these peptidases, as well as for the other genes encoded in the

Dilutions of each protein in the appropriate gel filtration buffer were equilibrated to crystallization temperature. Crystals were grown at 20°C using hanging drop vapor diffusion with 1:1 mixture of protein to reservoir buffer (drop size 1.6 μl). Crystals formed with the following conditions: 10 mg/ml PA0462 (18–169) in 0.25 M sodium phosphate dibasic and 24% PEG 3350; or 5 mg/ml Pfl01_1762 (20–178) in 0.2M ammonium acetate, 20% PEG 3350 and 0.1 M HEPES pH 8.0. Crystals were equilibrated for at least 7 days before harvesting. Crystals were cryoprotected in reservoir buffer with 20% xylitol, then flash frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected by synchrotron radiation at Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) and NE-CAT 24ID-C and 24ID-E beamlines at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory.

5 mg/ml (289 μM) of purified PA0462 (18–169) or PA1768 (23–179) protein was injected onto a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with gel filtration buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl). An Agilent G1310A isocratic pump was used to run samples at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min through the gel filtration column coupled to a static 18-angle light scattering detector (DAWN HELEOS-II, Wyatt Technology) and a refractive index detector (Optilab T-rEX, Wyatt Technology). Data were collected every second. Data analysis was performed with Astra 6.1 (Wyatt Technology) yielding the molar mass and mass distribution (polydispersity) of the sample. Monomeric BSA (Sigma; 5 mg/ml) was used to normalize the light scattering detectors.
