Bacteria can sense a wide range of physical and chemical external cues, adapting their metabolic processes accordingly to survive in diverse environments. Pathogenic bacteria, in particular, detect both physical (e.g., surface properties) and chemical signals (e.g., Ca

T3SS, first identified in

Given its ability to infect a diverse range of hosts (mammals, insects, worms, amoebae, and plants),

The metabolic state significantly influences the T3SS, as studies have shown that a proficient Proton Motive Force (PMF) is essential for effector secretion [

Here, our findings demonstrate that the deletion of

Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are presented in

Following previously established methods, we employed homologous recombination using the sucrose-lethal

The plasmid pMS402, which carries a promoterless

Gene expression in liquid cultures was measured using

Cytotoxicity assays were conducted with slight modifications as previously described [

ExoS proteins were extracted using TCA precipitation as previously described [

The cabbage infection assay was performed as previously reported with minor modifications [

The biofilm formation assay was conducted as previously described with minor modifications [

Pyocyanin production was measured as previously described [

Bacterial motility was assessed as previously described [

Protease activity was assessed using a milk medium containing 2.5% skimmed milk powder and 1% agar to detect extracellular protease activity, as previously described [

Antibiotic susceptibility assays were performed as previously described with minor modifications [

NADH and NAD

Data were analyzed and visualized using GraphPad Prism, version 9.5. All experiments were conducted in triplicate and independently repeated three times. Statistical significance was assessed using two-tailed unpaired

During the preliminary screening for mutants related to the expression of the type III secretion system, several transposon mutants were identified that could potentially affect its expression. We selected one transposon insertion mutant within the

In summary, the results above indicate that the

To further explore whether

ExsD coding antiactivator which ExsC preferentially binds resulting in the release of ExsA, liberated ExsA then binds to target promoters and recruits RNA polymerase to activate the T3SS regulon [

These results presented above suggest that

We further validated the above results using cytotoxicity assays. Consistent with the expression data, the cytotoxicity of the supernatants from the overexpression of

The above results demonstrate that the expression of genes such as

Since the expression of

NADH dehydrogenases are commonly found in energy-transducing membranes, where they serve as key sites for initiating electron transport. As an electron acceptor, NAD

In addition, previous research has shown that the MIC of gentamicin for the ∆
