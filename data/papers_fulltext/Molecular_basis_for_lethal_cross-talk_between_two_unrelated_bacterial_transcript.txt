Control of bacterial gene expression is one of the most intriguing examples of biological plasticity in response to changing environmental conditions (

Model for horizontal gene transfer event (HGT) of the TF-linked R-M operon into a new host. If entering foreign TF (red) interferes with one or more host TFs (blue), there may be negative consequences for the recipient cell, up to and including lethality. In our model, the C regulatory protein from an R-M system participates in cross-talk with the RacR repressor, from the defective

It has recently been shown that mobility of DNA binding proteins is largely determined by non-specific DNA interactions, and that the size of the proteins has very little influence on their diffusion properties (

A typical TF’s action relies on a mixture of free diffusion and scanning of the cellular DNA

Different genetic contexts were designed to test the dynamics of C protein mobility: (a) the natural context of a single C-box target site in the ∼5 Mbp

Single molecule tracking of C protein::mVenus reveals considerable changes in mobility in the context of the target and off-target sites. (

These experiments suggest that C protein is strongly bound to the RM gene C-box locus, which is duplicated into two loci following DNA replication. Of note, any freely diffusing molecule can stay without motion for some time, so confinement will be somewhat convoluted with non-bound molecules, or molecules staying bound in a non-specific manner for some period of time. In

An off-target site in

As a further means to characterize target DNA-binding binding versus off-target binding, we used squared displacement (SQD) analysis, in which the probability of a certain jump distance (JD) is plotted, and data are fit with Rayleigh distributions that explain a probability distribution for nonnegative-valued random variables. JDs observed for C protein could not be explained by a single Rayleigh fit, but quite well by two distributions (

SQD analyses revealed that in the

In any event, the presence of a genomic off target site leads to a decrease in freely diffusing molecules, and an increase in medium – and slow-diffusing C protein. Of note, experiments were performed in rich medium, such that there are likely two to 4 off target sites on average in the growing culture (overlapping rounds of replication). Constrained motion (as derived from the medium mobile population) further increased by the addition of target sites on plasmids, and likewise slow/static motion. Thus, changes in binding-site availability lead to considerable, but not drastic changes in C protein mobility. Our data also suggest that specific binding sites on the chromosome (in this case the ‘off target’ sites) increase low protein mobility (specific DNA binding) to a similar extent as specific binding sites on several plasmids (C protein ‘target’ sites), or even more so in the

Full knowledge of a complete bacterial transcriptional genetic network does not exist. While

It has been suggested that the transcriptional cross-talk is more likely to occur for TFs recognizing shorter DNA sequences or partially degenerate ones, where there is a high chance that many less specific sites are present at genome (
