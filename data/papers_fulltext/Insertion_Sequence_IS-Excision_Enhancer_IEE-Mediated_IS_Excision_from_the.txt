Insertion sequences (ISs) are small transposable elements (typically 0.7 to 2.5 kb in size) that encode a transposase (TPase) and are usually flanked by terminal inverted repeats (IRs) (

Another important aspect of the impact of IS insertion/transposition on their bacterial hosts is the modulation of gene expression by gene inactivation or activation (

Lactose fermentation is one of the general biochemical characteristics of coliform bacteria belonging to four genera of

In this study, we performed detailed analyses of the lactose utilization ability of a set of O121:H19 strains and their mutants under several culture conditions and revealed that IEE-mediated IS

Involvement of IEE in the emergence of lactose-fermenting subclones during cultivation and the effect of lactose. The proportion of lactose-fermenting subclones in the colonies of each strain cultured on MacConkey agar base plates supplemented with or without 1% lactose for 40 h at 37°C was determined by suspending 5 colonies in LB, inoculating the suspensions on MacConkey agar base supplemented with 1% lactose (MAC plate), and counting red colonies after 16 h of incubation at 37°C. For spot analyses, cell suspensions (approximately 1.3 × 10

Bacteria were grown in the following media: LB (1% [wt/vol] Bacto Tryptone, Gibco; 0.5% [wt/vol] Bacto Yeast Extract, Becton, Dickinson [BD]; 1% [wt/vol] sodium chloride, nacalai tesque), LB agar (LB containing 1.5% [wt/vol] Bacto Agar, BD), MAC (Difco MacConkey agar base, BD; 1% [wt/vol] lactose monohydrate, Wako), MAC not supplemented with lactose (Difco MacConkey agar base), Pearlcore MAC (Pearlcore MacConkey agar, Eiken Chemical Co.), MM (Difco M9 Minimal Salts, BD; 2 mM magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, Wako; 0.1% D-[+]-glucose, nacalai tesque), and MM agar (MM containing 1.5% [wt/vol] Bacto Agar). The growth media were supplemented with regents and antibiotics when necessary at the following concentrations: L(+)-arabinose (Wako), 1 mM; IPTG (Wako), 0.3 mM or 30 mM; X-gal (TaKaRa), 40 μg/mL; sucrose (nacalai tesque), 10% (wt/vol); D-(+)-glucose, 0.1%, 0.2%, or 0.4% (wt/vol); lactose monohydrate, 1.0% (wt/vol); D(+)-maltose monohydrate (Wako), 1.0% (wt/vol); chloramphenicol (Wako), 20 μg/mL; ampicillin (Sigma), 50 μg/mL; tetracycline (nacalai tesque), 10 μg/mL.
