Briefly, primers mufC-1/mufC-2 and mufC-3/mufC-4 were used to generate ∼1-kbp PCR fragments of the up- and down-stream flanking region of

For RNA-seq analysis,

Total RNA was extracted from bacterial cells using the Bacterial RNA kit (innuPREP, IST Innuscreen). The RNA samples were treated with 2 U of RNase-free DNase I (Invitrogen) to remove potential DNA contamination. The raw RNA product was quantified using a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer, and further quantified using Quant-it™ RiboGreen (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Qualitative analysis was performed with the Fragment Analyzer RNA Analysis, HS RNA kit (15NT) (Agilent). Libraries were prepared using the Illumina Stranded Total RNA Prep, ligation with RiboZero Plus (Illumina), following the manufacturer's instructions. Final library quality control was conducted using Pico488 (Lumiprobe) and the dsDNA 915 Reagent Kit (Agilent). At least 5 + 5 M paired-end reads were produced per sample, which passed Illumina's chastity filter. The reads were then demultiplexed with zero index base mismatches and Illumina adapter trimming using Illumina's bcl2fastq software, version 2.20.0.422 (no further refinement or selection). The quality of the fastq formatted reads was assessed with the FastQC software, version 0.11.9.

Comparison of gene expression between the sample groups was performed using DESeq2 (

Other notable genes that were downregulated during the early-exponential phase compared to the stationary phase included those involved in ascorbic acid metabolism/transport genes, glycogen metabolism, and putative metal (Fe, Zn, Mn, K) transport. GSEA revealed that several KEGG pathways were differentially regulated during the early-exponential phase compared to the stationary phase. Fatty acid biosynthesis genes and the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway were among the upregulated pathways during the early-exponential phase, whereas galactose and histidine pathways were among those upregulated during the mid-exponential phase (

Bacterial NRP production often varies across different growth phases. For instance,

Another biosynthetic gene cluster, BGC2, comprising 19 genes, showed significant upregulation in our biofilm transcriptome analysis. While the product of this cluster remains unidentified, it is hypothesized to be one of seven natural product BGCs in
