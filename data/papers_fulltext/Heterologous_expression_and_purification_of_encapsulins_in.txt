Section A outlines the steps required to PCR amplify and insert a single gene or a complete operon into the pGM1190 vector

PCR amplify insert using forward primer with overhang 5’-GTCAGAGAAGGGAGCGGA

Note: PCR amplification from GC-rich templates such as

Cut pGM1190 vector (2 µg) with BamHI and NdeI restriction enzymes using manufacturer's recommended protocol.

Note: 2 µg of pGM1190 vector should be sufficient for performing at least five Gibson assembly reactions in the later steps and compensate for low yields that commonly occur when purifying DNA by agarose gel extraction.

Run the digested pGM1190 vector from Step A.2. and PCR-amplified insert from Step A.1. over 1% agarose gel at 125 V for approximately 20–25 min, or until dye front reaches the end of the agarose gel.

Extract and purify DNA from Step 3 using NEB Monarch DNA gel extraction kit according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol.

Gibson assemble the insert and vector using 2X Gibson Master Mix according to the manufacturer's protocol. Our standard protocol is to prepare the mix with a 3:1 molar ratio of insert to template and incubate at 50°C for 15 min. Longer incubation times may be used when multiple fragments are being assembled in the same reaction.

Transform electrocompetent

Resuspend the electroporated cells in 300 μL of SOC outgrowth media and pipette into a sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Shake the tubes at 200 rpm and 37°C for 45 min.

Plate 100 μL of the transformants on LB-agar plates containing 50 μg/mL apramycin. Incubate the plates for 18 h at 37°C.

Note: It may be useful to also plate 100 μL of a 1:10 dilution as competency can vary among batches and suppliers.

Screen colonies for insert by colony PCR or by restriction digest.

Pick 2–4 colonies and prepare overnight cultures in 5 mL LB containing 50 μg/mL apramycin.

Purify plasmids from the overnight growths using Qiagen miniprep plasmid extraction kit following the manufacturer's protocols.

Sequence the plasmids by Sanger sequencing.

After the plasmid sequence has been verified by Sanger sequencing, transform

Take 500 μL of the remaining resuspended stock and add 500 μL of sterile 50% glycerol. Mix, and store at -80°C as a stock for future use.

Note: Steps B.1. and B.2. assume the reader does not already have a viable

Store plates inverted at 30°C for 2–5 days until plates are rich with visible spores. Refer to

Note: Once sporulated, plates can be stored at 4°C for 1-2 months. However, it is best practice to use fresh spores for conjugation.

When ready to prepare a spore stock for conjugation, pipette 10 mL of 2X-YT onto the plate. Refer to

Use a sterile cotton swab to gently remove the spores from the surface of the plate. Be careful not to dig into the MS-agar.

After the spores are completely resuspended, pipette them into a sterile 15 mL conical tube and vortex vigorously to break apart spore chains.

Pour over a sterile syringe containing a sterile cotton plug. Collect the flowthrough in a sterile conical tube.

Centrifuge the tube for 10 min at 3800 x g at 4°C to pellet spores.

Carefully discard the clarified supernatant.

Resuspend the spore pellet in 2 mL 2X-YT. This spore stock can be used for downstream conjugations and can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

a. Note: The spore stock at this stage can also be stored in 20% glycerol at -80°C instead of 2X-YT. Spores from the 20% glycerol stock can also be used in the subsequent conjugation steps in Section C, however, we have observed significantly lower conjugation efficiencies from the 20% glycerol stocks. If a glycerol stock is used for conjugation, we recommend centrifuging the thawed glycerol stock for 10 min at 3800 x g to pellet the spores, then resuspend the spores in 2X-YT to be used in Section C.

Section C provides the necessary steps to transfer the modified pGM1190 vector into

The day before the conjugation, prepare an overnight culture of 20 mL LB containing 50 μg/mL apramycin, 30 μg/mL chloramphenicol, and 50 μg/mL kanamycin. Inoculate the 20 mL LB overnight culture with a colony of

The next day, centrifuge the

Pipette 200 μL of the prepared spore stock from Step B.10. into a sterile microcentrifuge tube and incubate at 50°C for 10 min to activate the spores. After 10 min, the tube containing the spores can be stored at room temperature to briefly cool prior to conjugation.

Dispose of the supernatant from Step C.2., resuspend the

Repeat Step C.4.

Mix 500 μL of the

Pipette 200 μL, 100 μL, and 50 μL of the conjugation mix on separate MS-Agar plates containing 10 mM MgCl

The following day prepare a solution containing 1 mg/mL nalidixic acid (from a stock in 300 mM NaOH) and 1 mg/mL apramycin in sterile water. Prepare 1 mL of this mixture for each plate to be overlayed.

Pipette 1 mL of the antibiotic overlay mixture to each plate. Spread the antibiotic over the plate by gently rocking. A spreader may be used to help spread the overlay, but it is not necessary and must be used very gently.

Incubate the plates at 30°C for 3–5 days until spores are visible. See

Using sterile pipette tips or toothpicks, pick 4 spore colonies from Step C.11. and streak the spore colonies onto an MS-agar plate containing 50 μg/mL apramycin and 25 μg/mL nalidixic acid.

Note: This step helps to enrich the

Incubate the struck plate at 30°C for 3–5 days until spores are visible. See



Section D provides the necessary steps for expressing an encapsulin or encapsulin-containing operon that has been inserted in the pGM1190 vector. The steps for Section D are illustrated in

Prepare a sterile 125 mL baffled flask by adding 3–6 mm glass beads and autoclaving on dry cycle.

Prepare 500 mL YEME media stock.

Add 25 mL YEME to autoclaved 125 mL baffle flask.

Add 25 μL of 50 mg/mL apramycin to the flask.

Using a pipette tip, scrape off approximately ¼ of the spores from a single struck colony in Step C.13. Use this to inoculate the YEME media.

Shake at 30°C for ca. 72 h, or until O.D. 600 reaches approximately 0.4–0.8. The culture may start to appear red due to production of secondary metabolites.

When the O.D. 600 reaches 0.4–0.8, induce protein expression by adding 10 μL of 50 mg/mL thiostrepton in DMSO to bring the thiostrepton concentration to 20 μg/mL.

Note: The amount of thiostrepton can be modified to modulate expression levels if needed. Refer to

Express the cells with shaking at 30°C for 24–72 h. The media will often appear dark red or dark blue due to the production of secondary metabolites.

After cells have been expressed for the desired amount of time, centrifuge cells for 10 min at 8000 x g. Discard the supernatant, and store cell pellet at -20°C. For longer term storage, store cell pellet at -80°C.

Section E outlines the steps required to purify overexpressed encapsulins from

Prepare 1 L of lysis buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl

Weigh the frozen cell pellet from Step D.9. Add cold lysis buffer at a ratio of 5 mL / 1 gram of cell pellet. Keep the lysate on ice as much as possible for the remainder of the purification.

Add 1 mg/mL of lysozyme to the lysis buffer.

Add 1 μL of Benzonase nuclease to the lysis buffer.

Add SIGMA

Sonicate the cell pellet using a 1/8-inch diameter tip with the following parameters: 80% power (18 watts), 10 s on, 20 s off, 3 min total sonication time. Keep the tube containing the lysate on ice the entire time.

Centrifuge the cell lysate for 10 min, 20,000 x g at 4°C in order to remove cell debris.

Carefully collect supernatant into a 15 mL conical tube and place at 4°C for 30 min to improve Benzonase digestion of contaminating nucleic acids.

Note: If nucleic acid contamination is not a concern, Step E.8. is not necessary.

Add ammonium sulfate to the lysate to 50% saturation. For 1 mL of lysate, add 314 mg of ammonium sulfate. This can be scaled according to the volume of the lysate.

Note: Ammonium sulfate at 50% saturation is a general recommendation for encapsulins. However, the amount of ammonium sulfate added may have to be adjusted depending on the surface charge distribution of the encapsulin protein being purified.

Gently rock at 4°C for at least 30 min to precipitate protein.

Note: Longer incubations in ammonium sulfate can often increase yield.

Centrifuge sample for 10 min at 10,000 x g, 4°C to precipitate the protein sample.

Resuspend the protein pellet immediately in 10 mL of 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl

Add 0.5 μL of Benzonase nuclease to the sample. Let the protein sample incubate at 4°C for 15–30 min.

Centrifuge the protein sample for 10 min, 10,000 x g, 4°C. There will likely be a deep red pellet consisting mostly of insoluble material. The supernatant may also appear red.

Run the clarified supernatant over a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column pre-equilibrated in 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 7.5 at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min and collect 1 mL fractions. T1 encapsulins typically elute between 10 and 13 mL. See
