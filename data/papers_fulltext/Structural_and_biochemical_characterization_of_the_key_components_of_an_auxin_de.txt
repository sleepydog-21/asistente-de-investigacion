Auxin is a vital phytohormone in plants, affecting almost all the aspects of plant’s life. In the meristems, auxin functions as a regulator of cell division, elongation, and differentiation, determining the growth and architectures of shoots and roots [

Plants are associated with millions of microorganisms. The plant–microbiota interaction serves as an important layer of auxin gradient regulation, tuning plant development, phenotypes, and fitness [

IadD features a Rieske domain (residues 44–160) and a catalytic domain (residues 1–43 and 161–437) (

To understand the binding of IAA with IadD, we then determined a 2.6 Å cryo-EM structure of IadD/E complexed with IAA (

The Rieske dioxygenases usually work in combination with a reductase or both reductase and ferredoxin components, forming a two- or three-component dioxygenase system, to oxidize substrates [

Next, we determined the crystallographic structure of IadC at a resolution of 1.68 Å (

Mutagenesis studies were then performed to further confirm the functional role of IadC in IAA transformation. FMN is thought to mediate electron transfer from the NADH electron donor to the [2Fe-2S] electron acceptor, which further delivers the electrons to the dioxygenase for the catalysis reaction [

In addition to IAA, other auxin analogs also play essential roles in plant growth and development. We therefore further examined whether the IadD/E-IadC system could transform IAA analogs. While 4-Cl-IAA was transformed with reduced efficiency, IadD/E-IadC could not catalyze the turnover of IAA analogs such as IBA and IPA (

Next, we set out to identify the product of IAA transformed by this new dioxygenase system. To this end, we performed the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analyses. IAA was treated in vitro with the IadD/E-IadC enzymes till complete consumption of IAA. The reacted mixture was first denatured and analyzed using HPLC.

ITC experiments were performed using a MicroCal PEAQ-ITC system (Malvern). All the experiments were performed at 25°P in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mM NaCl (unless otherwise stated). A typical titration experiment involved 18 injections of IAA solution (500 to 2,000 μM) into the cell containing protein of interest (30 to 100 μM) with a time spacing of 120 s. Data was analyzed using the MicroCal PEAQ-ITC analysis software. All the measurements were repeated at least 2 times.

TSA was performed to examine the binding of Iad proteins with IAA and analogs. Ligands concentrations were tested at 2- to 100-fold excess (10 to 1,000 μM) relative to the proteins (5 μM). The fluorescence dye SYPRO Orange at a final of 200-fold dilution was used to monitor the unfolding of proteins. The protein and ligand were incubated for 10 min at room temperature before the addition of SYPRO Orange dye. The QuantStudio 1 Plus real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher) was used to control the temperature increasing from 25°1 to 99°t with an increment of 0.5°n and to monitor the fluorescence (excitation: 520 ± 10 nm and emission: 558 ± 10 nm). Each tested group was run in triplicate and repeated. Data was imported to the Protein Thermal Shift software for analysis and plotting.

The gel-filtration assay for the IadD/IadE complex was carried out using the HiLoad 200 column (Cytiva). IadD/E purified by the cation exchange chromatography was concentrated to 20 mg/ml and loaded into the column pre-equilibrated with the running buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM DTT. The peak fractions were collected and analyzed with SDS-PAGE.

The purified IadD/E complex sample was diluted to 0.5 mg/ml using the sample buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mM NaCl and subjected to the sedimentation velocity measurements using an Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman-Coulter).

In vitro assay was performed to test the capability of IadC/D/E enzymes encoded by the

The reacted mixture with almost all the IAA substrate consumed from the in vitro IAA transformation assay was denatured by heat and the supernatant was collected for HPLC analysis on a Shimadzu LC-40 HPLC machine equipped with an InertSustain 5 μM C18 HPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm). The UV detection was carried out at 260 nm, following separation using water (solvent A) and methanol (solvent B) as mobile phase with a linear gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min as follows: 0 to 5 min, 5% B; 5 to 15 min, 10% B; 15 to 20 min, 50% B; 20 to 22 min, 50% B; 22 to 25 min, 95% B; 25 to 33 min, 95% B. The peak fraction with a retention time of about 5.4 min was collected and re-dissolved in water containing 10% methanol after removing the solvent under vacuum. HRMS was performed with an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). Pure IAA, NADH, NAD

Purified adK2, IadD/E complex, and IadC were concentrated to 15 to 20 mg/ml. Protein crystallization was performed by mixing 1 μl of protein solution with 1 μl of the crystallization buffer using the sitting drop method. Crystals of IadK2 protein were grown in a reservoir solution containing 27% w/v polyethylene glycol 3,350, 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.60); 1 M cobalt (II) chloride hexahydrate. IadD/E crystals were obtained at 18°E in a reservoir solution containing 28% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 0.05 M sodium cacodylate trihydrate (pH 6.0), 0.05 M magnesium acetate tetrahydrate, 40% (v/v) 1,3-propanediol. Crystals of IadC protein were grown at 18°p in a reservoir solution containing 0.1 M Bis-tris propane (pH 7.1), 1.2 M sodium malonate (pH 7.0), 0.1 M calcium chloride dihydrate. Crystals were cryo-protected in the mother liquor supplemented with 20% glycerol before flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection.

X-ray diffraction datasets were collected at beamline BL19U1 of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). Structure determination was performed by CCP4I2 package [

Docking and MD simulation analysis were performed to define the binding site of IAA in IadK2. The initial binding pocket was selected by referring to the homologous structure (PDB ID: 4FB4). Molecular docking of IAA anion to the potential binding site was performed using AutoDock Vina [

Purified IadD/E complex was incubated with 20-fold molar excess IAA. Aliquots of 4 μL samples were applied to glow-discharged holey carbon girds (Cu, R1.2/1.3, 300 mesh, Quantifoil). The grids were blotted with force 2 for 3 s and plunged into liquid ethane using a Vitrobot (FEI Thermo Fisher). Cryo-EM data were collected with a Titan Krios microscope (FEI) operated at 300 kV and images were collected using EPU at a nominal magnification of 105,000× (resulting in a calibrated physical pixel size of 0.85 Å/pixel) with a defocus range from −1.2 μM to −2.2 μM. The images were recorded on a K3 summit electron direct detector (Gatan). A dose rate of 15 electrons per pixel per second and an exposure time of 2.5 s were used, generating 40 movie frames with a total dose of approximately 54 electrons per Å2. A total of 2,122 movie stacks were collected (

The movie frames were imported to RELION-3 [

Please accept my apologies for the delays that you have experienced during the peer review process. Your manuscript has now been evaluated by the PLOS Biology editors, an Academic Editor with relevant expertise, and by three independent reviewers.

In light of the reviews, which you will find at the end of this email, we would like to invite you to revise the work to thoroughly address the reviewers' reports.

As you will see, the reviewers think the study is interesting and well done, but raise concerns about the lack of comparison with a previous study in Nature Microbiology that recently characterized an iac/iad auxin degradation locus (Conway et al, 2022, PMID 36266335), as well as noting that different nomenclature appears to be used to define the operon (adg vs iac). I have provided some specific comments from the Academic Editor on this point below the reviewer reports, and we ask that you please clarify whether your study is focusing on the same operon where a different reaction and degradation product are described, or whether the paper focuses on a distinct operon. In addition, the reviewers also ask for several additional control experiments, including a mutational validation in AdgA to provide further support for the IAA binding model and using PAA in the ITC assays to strengthen the conclusions regarding substrate specificity.

Given the extent of revision needed, we cannot make a decision about publication until we have seen the revised manuscript and your response to the reviewers' comments. Your revised manuscript is likely to be sent for further evaluation by all or a subset of the reviewers.

REVIEWS:

Reviewer #1: The manuscript by Ma, et al. describes the ligand binding, structure and activity of proteins from the Variovorax auxin-degradation operon responsible for IAA binding and degradation. The authors performed crystallization studies and enzymatic assays to demonstrate IAA binding and enzymatic activity by AdgB, I, J and H. The degradation product of IAA catalysed by AdI/H/J was further characterized by mass spectrometry. The genes responsible for IAA degradation were then tested in E. coli and IAA degradation tested. Understanding the enzymes involved in IAA degradation and the crosstalk between plants and bacteria is of broad interest to the plant biology community.

Certain points need to be addressed to better clarify the results of the manuscript and to put it into a broader context of what is known about IAA degrading bacteria-

The results need to be discussed in context of recent literature, in particular Conway, et al. 2022

I am unclear as to the applications the authors envision for this operon in engineering the rhizosphere microbiome. This would be making transgenic soil bacteria to alter RGI?

ITC measurements need s.d. or s.e.m. How many times were these measurements performed? For thermal shift assays in Fig. 1 the error bars are very faint and hard to see.

Given that AdgB is not in complex with IAA, docking studies were done. SAXS could be used to determine if AdgB adopts closed conformation upon IAA binding as co-crystallisation and soaking did not work.

Mutations of AdgA to bind IAA based on the structural and modelling studies of AdgB would be interesting to further support the model for IAA specific binding.

The structures in Fig.3 examine both X-ray and EM structures with the X-ray structure of AdgH/I in the apo form and the EM structure in the IAA bound form. A larger portion of the EM map should be shown around the active site and more detailed comparison of the conformation of the side chains in the apo and ligand bound form described. How well-positioned are the side chains in the EM model vs. the X-ray structure?

Fig. 4 -The schematic illustration is too small and uninterpretable. It is unclear where the electron is coming from and where it is going and how the reaction is catalysed.

For the crystal tables, please provide CC1/2, Ramachandran statistics should be included. The clash scores and R factors are quite high for 7YLT. Is this structure fully refined? Also there seem to be a lot of RSTZ outliers for all structures.

Supp Fig. 3 The SAXS experimental curve and theoretical model are very different. The fit looks extremely poor, especially at high q range, can the authors address this?

Reviewer #2: This manuscript is very straightforward, and summarizes an impressive amount of work, including the biochemical characterization of three different enzymes involved in IAA transport and metabolism. Overall, the claims are well supported. The findings are important, as they increase our understanding of how microbes can alter the concentration of the plant hormone IAA, an auxin, in plant roots and the rhizosphere.

The manuscript is succinctly written, and in some places additional key information and details need to be provided so assist the readers in understanding the experiments and to strengthen the rationale for the work. Additionally, I believe use of the term "degradation" is often inappropriately used, and thus confusing to the reader.

Scientific comments and concerns

1. An IAA degradation locus referred to as iad has been recently described (Conway et al, 2022 Nature Microbiology). Is the adg locus discussed here distinct from that locus?

2. The naturally occurring auxin phenyl acetic acid (PAA) should be included in the ITC experiments investigating substrate specificity. This is important to examine before the authors can claim that the protein has specificity for bicyclic compounds.

3. I was confused by the use of the term degradation, when the authors actually mean transformation (or conversion) of IAA into oxIAA, which is presumably inactive, but still present in the cell.

4. It seems the authors believe that the SBP proteins are required for entry of IAA into the cell. However, at acidic pH (e.g. pH 5.8) much of the IAA is protonated, and thus may be able to diffuse across the membrane without the aid of transporters (at least this is what plant biologists who study IAA assume). It would be very interesting to test this idea in a Varivorax adgB mutant. This question may be beyond the scope of this manuscript, but could be addressed in future studies.

5. The question about pH and entry of IAA into bacteria cells arose when I was considering the experiment shown in Fig. 6 (ecotpic expression of adg genes in E. coli). Presumably these experiments were done in pH7 media, but it would be helpful to confirm that the LB used in the IAA degradation assays was at pH 7 .

6. A control is missing for the experiment shown in Fig. 4 B. How can we ensure that the colormetric change does not occur spontaneously given enough time? A "no enzyme added" negative control is needed. Also, what is the time frame shown for the panel on the right, compared to the graph on the left?

7. More information regarding what is shown on the y axes in fig. 4 would be helpful.

Editorial comments

Introduction:

1. I believe the PAA, a natural and active form of auxin, is more abundant than IAA in many plants.

2. Is reference 9 the appropriate citation for the general statement that "most rhizobacteria are found capable of producing IAA"? Referencing a review article would be more suitable.

8. An IAA degradation locus referred to as iad has been recently described (Conway et al, 2022 Nature Microbiology). Are the adg genes here distinct from that locus?

9. Is it appropriate to refer to conversion of IAA to oxIAA as degradation? I believe the term "inactivation" might be more appropriately used throughout the manuscript, until the discussion section, when a larger picture is provided.

10. Figure 5 legend:

a. panel A- it would be helpful to indicate the color of the traces for before and after the transformation

b. Panel c: what concentration of compounds are used in the experiment shown?

Results

11. Page 4, line the term "predicted" should be used when referring to products of genes that have not been characterized yet. The adg operon IS PREDICTED to encode….

Methods:

12. The Genbank accession numbers should be provided so that readers can analyze the genes/proteins

Reviewer #3: This study builds on an earlier report by Finkel et al., 2020, which defined an auxin (IAA) degradation locus in the bacterium Variovorax paradoxus. Here the authors define (1) the structure and auxin binding mechanism for the ABC transporter solute binding protein AdgB and (2) a structure of an AdgH/AdgI non-heme Rieske dioxygenase complex. The authors further demonstrate that AdgH/I/J can catalyze IAA degradation to oxIAA. Overall, this is a well designed/executed study that combines quantitative biochemistry, structural biology and enzymology to characterize a novel bacterial IAA degradation pathway. The crystal and cryoEM structure show good sterochemistry and refinement statistics. As a non-expert in this field, I had however some difficulties to compare this work to earlier studies. In addition, there are some minor technical issues worth considering. I will summarize my points below:

1. MAJOR: A recent study by Conway et al, 2022 (

2. MAJOR: I understand that iadB/adgB is the bacterial ABC transporter enabling IAA uptake into the cytoplasm of Variovorax. Assuming that all other degradation enzymes are present in the cytoplasm, does that mean that adgB is essential for both the iadC/D/E and the adgH/I/J pathways? Has this been experimentally tested, for example by genetic epistasis analysis?

3. MINOR: As anticipated, AdgB could engage IAA with nanomolar affinity, whereas no obvious binding was detected for AdgA and IAA. Why was it anticipated that AdgA would not bind IAA? This could be discussed later in the text, when the authors compare the degree of conservation of the putative IAA binding pocket in both proteins.

4. MAJOR: Fig. 1C, can the authors rationalize the bimodal binding behavior for recombinant AdgB in the ITC assay? The structure seems to indicate a single IAA binding site?

5. MAJOR: Conway et al, 2022 et al reported iad/C/D/E to form an IAA degradation complex. Have these proteins been tested in the ITC assays shown in Supplementary Fig. 1, and if so, why was no binding detected? It seems that MarR domains, that show high affinity IAA binding (Kd ~0.3 uM) (Conway et al. 2022) were excluded from the analysis in Fig. S1? This should be mentioned in the figure legend.

6. MAJOR: In the Figure 5, the authors nicely demonstrate that AdgH/I/J can catalyze IAA oxidation. Can these data be integrated with the metabolic analysis by Conway et al, 2022, Fig. 4? Could this imply that iadCDE and adgHIJ are part of one degradation pathway, and that adgHIJ may use 2-hydroxy-indole-3-acetic acid or dioxindole-3-acetic acid (DOAA) as substrates in vivo? Please clarify.

7. MINOR: Figure 5a/Figure S7. Could the HPLC buffer system or column be optimized to obtain a sharper peak for IAA?

8. MAJOR: Fig. 5. I would recommend to determine rate constants for the different substrates.

9. MINOR: Fig. 6D may need to be revised depending on the outcome of the analysis on point 6 (see above)

10. MINOR: Introduction: "Elucidating the underlying mechanism of bacterial IAA degradation would help to maximize the beneficial effects of auxin degradation for ecological agriculture." How would that be achieved?

11. MINOR: Introduction: "Dissecting and defining the functional mechanism of the adg operon is therefore of significant importance for the applications in ecological and stress agricultures." What type of application exist that make use of bacterial IAA degradation, please specify.

*COMMENTS FROM THE ACADEMIC EDITOR*

I agree with the reviewers that the lack of comparison the Conway is a major weakness and it isn’t clear where the “adg” nomenclature/operon (instead “iac” in the Finkle 2020 paper and iac/iad in the Conway 2022 paper) came from. Similarly, the operon structures in Conway seems a bit different than in this paper so I’m wondering if these are distinct operons. However, if that’s the case, then the authors of this paper should clearly state how they decided to study the adg operon and it’s demonstrated role in auxin degradation (and if it is different from or the same as iac or iad).

Futhermore, the IAA degradation reactions described are different. The Conway paper describes that the iac operon breaks down IAA through DOAA to catechol while the iad locus converts IAA to anthranilic acid. In this paper, they describe oxIAA as the next step in degradation by the adg degrading operon. Either Ma et al. are describing the same operon but found a different reaction and degradation product or they’re describing a distinct operon suggesting 3 Variovorax degrading pathways. Importantly, I couldn’t find the species or strain listed anywhere in the materials and methods so it’s not clear if this is the same strain. This definitely needs to be clarified and either outcome (two mechanisms, or inconsistency with previous papers) should be clarified.

NOTE: If Supporting Information files are included with your article, note that these are not copyedited and will be published as they are submitted. Please ensure that these files are legible and of high quality (at least 300 dpi) in an easily accessible file format. For this reason, please be aware that any references listed in an SI file will not be indexed. For more information, see our Supporting Information guidelines:

*Published Peer Review History*

Please note that you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out. Please see here for more details:



*Press*

Should you, your institution's press office or the journal office choose to press release your paper, please ensure you have opted out of Early Article Posting on the submission form. We ask that you notify us as soon as possible if you or your institution is planning to press release the article.

*Protocols deposition*

To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that if applicable you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option for publishing peer-reviewed Lab Protocol articles, which describe protocols hosted on protocols.io. Read more information on sharing protocols at

Please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions.

Kind regards,
