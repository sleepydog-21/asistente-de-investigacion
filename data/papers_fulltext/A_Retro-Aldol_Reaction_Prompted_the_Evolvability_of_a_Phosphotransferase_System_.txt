In early life, autotrophs might have provided their cell mass as viable nutrients to heterotrophs (

We hypothesized that the inability to utilize rare sugars can be explained by the lack of accessibility to these sugars in nature during evolution. There are many unresolved issues regarding the evolution of sugar preferences, including how sugars define cellular sugar preferences (

To assess the effects of ALE-induced genome mutations on bacterial growth, we introduced the CraBS_Δ67, FruK_A39S, Δ

In the case of double mutant strains, the dCF strain (CraBS_Δ67 and FruK_A39S, directly involved in sugar PTS) on

We further analyzed correlations between genotypic and phenotypic changes to identify the minimal genetic elements for rare sugar utilization. For various mutant strains with an ability to use

Notably, BL_GatY-harboring strains (e.g., sF

Nevertheless, the combination of mutations indicated that PTS activity and the expression levels of individual components contribute differentially to the evolution of rare sugar utilization. A differential-expression analysis of the WT and CraBS_Δ67-containing mutant strains (i.e., dCF and YF2) showed two noticeable features relevant to the catabolic pathway for

The diversity of sugar catabolic pathways, including sugar PTS, enables heterotrophs to efficiently consume abundant sugars (e.g.,

We showed that the availability of a rare sugar and appropriate aldolases for their phosphorylated sugars could drive enteric bacteria to use a nonusable sugar within 500 h, corresponding to ~500 generations in

The genotyping of individual bacterial cells derived from populations corresponding to the WT progenitor and adaptive variants during serial transfer allowed us to track the evolutionary trajectory of traits (

Finally, we examined whether an AI-aided isomerization of

For the purification of recombinant enzymes, centrifuged cells were resuspended in 50 mL of 1× His-binding buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, pH 7.9) and disrupted by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 ×

Genomic DNA (gDNA) of ALE-induced strains was extracted using the Wizard Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and sequenced using the HiSeq 2500 or the NovaSeq 6000 S4 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Whole-genome libraries were generated by TruSeq nano DNA library construction for the Illumina sequencing platform. Paired-end reads were obtained after adapter trimming and quality-filtering using Trimmomatic version 0.39 (

Two genome-editing tools were used, the CRISPR-Cas9 system (

Total RNA was isolated from bacterial samples grown in M9 medium supplemented with each carbon source using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). All samples were ground in a mortar under liquid nitrogen before RNA extraction. Genomic DNA was eliminated by RNase-free DNase I treatment during the isolation procedure, and RNA extraction was then performed. RNA quantity and quality were determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. All RNA samples with an
