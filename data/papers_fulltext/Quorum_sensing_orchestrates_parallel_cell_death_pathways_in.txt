Quorum sensing (QS) is a process of bacterial cell–cell communication that depends on the production, release, accumulation, and detection of extracellular signal molecules called autoinducers (AIs) (

The bacterial type 6 secretion system (T6SS) is a contact-dependent nanomachine that delivers toxic molecules into other cells (

The cell death assay was previously reported (

Strains were cultured on LB agar medium exactly as described for the cell death assay. Subsequently, colonies were resuspended in PBS, 4 mm glass beads were added, and the suspensions subjected to vortex for 5 min to disperse aggregates. The resulting cell suspensions were treated for 15 min at room temperature with RNAProtect reagent per the manufacturer’s instructions. Thereafter, RNA isolation was performed as described previously (

Colonies were plated as described above for the cell death assay. Images of growing colonies were acquired with a Cytation 7 imaging plate reader (Biotek) as reported (
