Many organisms express multiple Fe-S assembly systems (e.g., NIF, ISC, and SUF), wherein the SUF system is largely restricted to organisms that are frequently exposed to Fe-S cluster–damaging conditions (

For overlap analysis of DEGs with the processed data of other studies, the significance of gene number overlap was determined by Fisher’s exact test on a two-by-two contingency table. The universal set of the genes was calculated on the basis of the intersection of total genes analyzed in the studies with our study. If this information was not available, then we took 3975 genes as the universal set (table S2).

Total bacterial RNA was extracted using the FastRNA Pro Blue Kit (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) and further purified using RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. For qRT-PCR analysis under different experiment setups, total RNA was extracted at indicated time points, followed by treatment with deoxyribonuclease (DNase). Approximately 600 ng of DNase-treated RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using random hexamer oligonucleotide primers (iScript Select cDNA Synthesis Kit, Bio-Rad, USA).
