To prevent the contamination of produce in the pre‐harvest environment, good agricultural practices must be strictly adhered to, including properly composting manure (if used), testing irrigation and other waters used (i.e. water used for pesticide and fertilizer application), ensuring wild animals are excluded from crop fields and minimizing the proximity of produce fields to confined animal feeding operations (Iwu & Okoh,

At a minimum, a bacterial biocontrol agent should be able to grow and persist on the target produce in both the pre‐ and post‐harvest environments and prevent the target pathogen's growth (Linares‐Morales et al.,
