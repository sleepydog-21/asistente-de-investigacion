Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a small circular double-stranded DNA genome, non-enveloped, and identified as the most common sexually transmitted infection (STIs) [

HPV is a substantial contributor to cancers of the anus, vagina, oropharynx, vulva, and almost all cervical cancers [

Latest research indicates that the human papilloma virus appreciably increases the risk of various types of cancer, especially cervical cancer. Vaccination and screening are among the main approaches to prevent and control this virus. Nevertheless, complete information about the frequency of HPV genotypes in different population groups, is not available. Consequently, this investigation was carried out to explore the frequency and spread of HPV genotypes based on genotype groups (high-risk, low-risk, and potentially high-risk) in individuals referring to the private laboratories of Mashhad in northeastern Iran in 2022–2023.

In this cross-sectional study, 428 samples, comprising 382 (89.3%) females and 46 (10.7%) males, referred to private laboratories in Mashhad, Iran bbetween January 10, 2022, and February 11, 2023, were assessed for HPV detection and determination of its genotypes distribution. Samples were collected by gynecologists and experienced laboratory personnel, which included tissues or cells in the cervix (Cervical) samples of cervical secretions for females and urine samples for males. Contributors who consented to participate in the study completed the informed consent form (IR.TUMS.SPH.REC.1402.317). Inclusion criteria included females who had abnormal cytological results and whose gynecologists had referred them to the laboratory for diagnostic tests and HPV genotyping or routine checkup. Also, males who had signs suspected of HPV infection or had recently had high-risk sex with an HPV-infected partner were included in this study. Among participants, the age range spanned from 17 to 70 years old. Exclusion criteria were those without consent of participation in the study.

Swab samples collected from females were transferred into a vial pre-filled with a liquid-based (Pap-Preps) preservative solution and kept at 2–8 °C until ready for analysis. Also, two urine samples were collected from males, including one first morning urine sample and another midstream urine sample. Finally, all samples collected from participants were stored at 4 °C, and lastly, 1 day after sampling, relevant laboratory tests were performed.

All steps before amplification, DNA extraction, and identification of HPV genotypes were executed in the molecular genetics department of the laboratory, in accordance with the protocols specified by the quality control manager and with the administration of RCCV (Research Center of Clinical Virology). HPV-DNA was extracted with a CedExtra purification kit (cedbio, Iran) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. In the next step, the HPV genotype was detected and determined by using the High + Low Papillomastrip kit (Operon, Spain). This kit can detect 19 high-risk genotypes including HPV-16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 69, 73, and 82 as well as detect 18 low-risk genotypes including HPV-6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 54, 61, 62, 67, 70, 71, 72, 74, 81, 83, 84, and 91.

Frequency, median, average and standard deviation were used to describe the data in this study. Mann Whitney U test was performed to test the equality of age and the Chi-square test was performed to test the equality of gender in HPV-positive and HPV-negative groups. A significant level was considered as 0.05. The statistical package IBM SPSS-27 was applied for analysis.

A total of 428 subjects were analyzed, among them 382 (89.3%) were female and 46 (10.7%) were male. The mean and standard deviation of age were 34.9 and 8.83, respectively. Out of 428 participants, the HPV test result was positive for 129 (30.1%) and negative for 299 (69.9%). Wald’s 95% confidence interval for the portion with positive test result was (25.4%-34.8%). Among female participants, 115 (30.1%) were identified positive for HPV infection (Wald’s 95% CI: 25.4% to 34.8%) and 267 (69.9%) were reported negative, while 14 (30.4%) were reported positive (Wald’s 95% CI: 17.1% to 43.7%), and 32 (69.6%) were negative for HPV infection among male participants. Among the people who referred to the laboratories, the prevalence of HPV infection was about 30%. HPV infection was not related to gender, statistically (Pearson Chi-Square statistic = 0.002, p-value = 0.963) Table

Age in HPV infection groups

Consistent with the genotypic groups among HPV-positive individuals, 81 patients (49.4%) had at least one high-risk genotype, 48 patients (29.2%) had at least one low-risk genotype, and 35 patients (21.3%) had at least one potential high-risk genotype. The results showed that the males examined in this study only had low-risk genotypes. Among the participants, 101 (78.3%) had only one group of genotypes (low-risk, high-risk, or potential high-risk) (Fig.

Schematic frequency and distribution in terms of percentage of genotypic groups (High-risk, Low-risk, or potentially high-risk) identified in infected people

Among 89 people (69%) with one genotype, 75 (84.3%) were female and 14 (15.7%) were male. Also, 40 patients (31%) with several HPV genotypes were identified, none of them were male. Among females with infection, 25 were identified as having two genotypes, and the highest number of genotypes identified among patients was 5 genotypes, which were identified in 3 females (2.3%). The most frequent genotype among the identified genotypes is HPV-6 (10.30%), followed by HPV-16 (8.7%), HPV-51 (7.7%), and HPV-39 (6.7%) among the four genotypes. On the other hand, HPV-11, HPV-61, HPV-91, and HPV-44 with a frequency of 1%, and HPV-18, HPV-40, HPV-84, HPV-83, and HPV-67 with a frequency of 0.5%, were among the lowest identified genotypes (Fig.

Our study reveals several significant findings regarding HPV infection and genotype distribution among the participants in Mashhad. We found that 30.1% of the 428 subjects tested positive for HPV, with no significant gender differences in infection rates (p-value = 0.963). The mean age of participants was 34.9 years, with HPV-positive individuals having a slightly lower mean age compared to those who were HPV-negative, and this difference was statistically significant (

Regardless of age, marital status, or socioeconomic status, unpublished data from Iran shows that during the past ten years, the number of sexually active Iranians with genital tract HPV infection has rapidly increased [

In line with the results of our study, which reported the prevalence of HPV in infected females was 30.1%, another study conducted in Tehran on 12,076 females reported an overall HPV infection prevalence of 38.68% [

These particular observations in Mashhad may be attributed to several reasons. As the capital of Khorasan Razavi province in northeastern Iran, Mashhad stands as the country's second most populous city after Tehran. This prominence results in patients from other cities being referred to Mashhad's medical facilities. Additionally, the city attracts millions of pilgrims annually from across Iran and other Muslim nations, which may also contribute to the findings observed in this study. Another significant contributing factor is the extremely low rate of HPV vaccination. In Iran, HPV vaccines are distributed by private entities, with no coverage or financial support from insurance companies. As a result, many individuals cannot afford the vaccine, making it inaccessible to a large portion of the population [

It's important to highlight that our study has several limitations. The limitation of our study is that since the HPV typing test is not available in all parts of the country and is expensive, it is impossible to properly compare the genotypes in our study divided by cities. In addition, larger-scale studies with more variables and larger populations are needed to acquire more precise results regarding HPV prevalence. The results of our study can be generalized to low- and middle-income countries, where screening and vaccination strategies should be more sensitive, and proper management should be done according to the genotypes in the rotation. Another limitation of our study is the potential for selection bias, as the data were collected from individuals referred to private laboratories. This specific population may not be fully representative of the general population, as individuals visiting private laboratories might differ in terms of socioeconomic status, health-seeking behavior, or other demographic factors. These differences could influence the findings and limit the generalizability of our results. Therefore, the outcomes of this study should be interpreted with caution, and further research is recommended to validate these findings in a more diverse and representative population. As well, a potential issue in our study is the inconsistency in HPV detection rates due to the different sample collection methods employed for females and males. Cervical swabs were used for females, whereas urine samples were collected from males. These differing methods may not be equally effective in detecting HPV, which could result in discrepancies in detection rates between genders. It is crucial to note that the laboratories involved in the study followed specific protocols that we could not alter. As a result, our analysis was based solely on the data provided by these laboratories, and this methodological difference should be considered when interpreting the findings.

In conclusion, the findings of our research show that the prevalence of HPV genotypes is 30% in both sexes. For example, although a significant prevalence of the HPV-6 genotype was seen in both sexes, another low-risk genotype (HPV-11) was not extensively detected among the participants. On the other hand, although the HPV-18 genotype was among the 5 genotypes that had the lowest prevalence, HPV-16, HPV-51, and HPV-39 genotypes were among the most common high-risk genotypes identified among the participants. These results probably show the difference in the prevalence of high-risk genotypes that are less common in this city. The findings of this study still emphasize the continuation of further investigations regarding the prevalence of HPV. Determining the prevalence of high-risk genotypes is critical for cancer prevention and improving screening strategies. Furthermore, the high prevalence of HR-HPV genotypes, especially the genotypes not covered by the vaccine, highlights the need to create and improve targeted educational programs to use safer sex methods and encourage the general population to promote vaccination.
