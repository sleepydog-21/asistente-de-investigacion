The plasmids remained stable as they were detected in samples from different sampling dates, while the patient underwent various antibiotic courses over several months, suggesting a maintenance mechanisms or a selective pressure, such as silver sulfadiazine used in the patient. A conjugative plasmid conferring heavy-metal resistance can be especially troublesome in combination with multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of

Infections by MDR organisms are increasingly complicating burn injuries.

Alternatively, active accumulation of copper in the cytosol as a response to infection with intra- and extra-cellular bacteria may serve as selective pressure for bacteria harbouring plasmids carrying the

Our findings highlight the risk of a plasmid type in which the presence of the
