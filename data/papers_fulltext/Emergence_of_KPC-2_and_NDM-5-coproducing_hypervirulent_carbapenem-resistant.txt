In China mainland, only five KPC-2 and NDM co-producing hv-CRKP isolates (KPC-2-NDM-hv-CRKPs) have been identified with different sequence types (ST11, ST86, and ST464) (

In this study, we not only featured the antibiotic-resistant and hypervirulent phenotypes in detail, but we also investigated the molecular mechanisms associated with multidrug resistance and hypervirulent phenotypes using whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We also analyzed the plasmid-backbone and conjugation modules and used a conjugation assay to further determine the self-transmissibility of these resistance and hypervirulence genes to study how these isolates emerged and the risk of dissemination of these isolates. According to our findings, the KPC-2-NDM-hv-CRKP poses a significant threat to healthcare networks, and steps should be taken to closely monitor and control the spread of superbugs with multidrug-resistant phenotypes and hypervirulence.

Here, we aimed to explore whether FK3122 and FK3127 pose hypervirulent features. The negative string test results indicated that the hypermucoviscous phenotypes were absent in FK3122 and FK3127. Quantitative siderophore assays indicated that FK3122 (ST11) and FK3127 (ST15) produced comparable siderophores with NTUH-K2044 (ST23, positive control), and produced substantially more siderophores than 1627 (ST11 cKP, negative control) and FK3036 (ST15 cKP, negative control) strains (

We found that FK3122 belonged to ST11-KL64 isolates and FK3127 belonged to ST15-KL24 isolates, both ST-type lineages in which they belong were associated with the CRKP epidemic. In these isolates, we discovered more than 10 resistant elements as well as several key resistance plasmids (
