The regulation of biofilm formation in

Small molecules that disrupt biofilm formation by interfering with key regulatory pathways have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics [

In this study, we aimed to identify and characterize small-molecule inhibitors of BrpT to develop a novel strategy for combating

To determine EC

To examine the cytotoxicity of BTI, monolayers of HeLa cells grown in a 96-well tissue culture plate (Nunc, Denmark) were treated with various concentrations of BTI, 1% DMSO (control), or wild-type

Biofilm formation was quantified using the crystal violet staining method as described previously [

For colony morphology analysis, 2 μl of

The 6xHis-tagged BrpT protein was overexpressed in

IVT assays were conducted as described previously [

Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 9.0 (GraphPad Software) and presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) from at least three independent replicates. Statistical significance was determined by Student's

We aimed to target BrpT to find selective and effective inhibitors of

Due to the absence of a previously discovered ligand or a putative ligand-binding site in BrpT, we screened a random chemical library containing 7,251 compounds (at 20 μM) using the

To validate the inhibitory effects of the hit molecules, we used

The chemical structure of 468F03, 1-{[2-(5-methylfuran-2-yl)-1,3-thiazol-4-yl]methyl}-1,2-dihydropyridin-2-one (C

Notably, 468F03 did not affect

Because BrpT is a crucial transcription regulator for multiple biofilm-associated genes (

We then assessed the impact of BTI on

Furthermore, to examine the effect of BTI on colony rugosity, the parental wild-type and the

To explore the impact of impaired

To elucidate the mechanism by which BTI inhibits BrpT’s activity as a transcription regulator, we conducted in vitro assays using purified BrpT protein. First, the direct interaction between BTI and BrpT was investigated using MST, wherein fluorescently labeled BrpT proteins were reacted with varying BTI concentrations. The result clearly indicates the direct binding of BTI to BrpT, as detected by the shifts in fluorescence intensity representing the changes in the thermophoretic movement of BrpT caused by BTI binding (

Next, the effect of BTI on BrpT activity as a transcription factor was analyzed using an IVT assay. The promoter region of

In this study, we identified BTI, a small molecule inhibitor that effectively inhibits the activity of BrpT, a key transcriptional regulator of biofilm formation in the human pathogen

The alarming rise of antibiotic resistance has necessitated the development of alternative strategies to combat bacterial infections. Targeting virulence and biofilm formation presents a promising approach to mitigate infection without exerting direct selective pressure for resistance [

Another important area for future study is the potential broad-spectrum activity of BTI against other

As a transcriptional regulator, BrpT directly binds to the promoter region of its regulon and facilitates the recruitment of RNA polymerase to promote transcription [

In conclusion, our study identified BTI as a promising small-molecule inhibitor of BrpT that effectively inhibits
