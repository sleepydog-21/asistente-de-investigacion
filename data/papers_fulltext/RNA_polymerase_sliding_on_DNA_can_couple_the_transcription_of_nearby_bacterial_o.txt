The core RNA polymerase (RNAP) in bacteria, which is composed of five subunits (

Bacterial metabolism requires the coordinated expression of multiple genes

While specific groups of bacterial operons may have correlated activities simply because they have common regulatory proteins (e.g., alternative sigma factors), there are also proximity-based mechanisms that can couple transcription of adjacent operons. Terminator readthrough, in which the RNAP fails to read a terminator signal and keeps elongating the mRNA molecule, can generate the joint transcription of co-directional neighboring operons. Transcription-coupled DNA supercoiling

Recently, a new mechanism of proximity-based transcription coupling was observed. Using single-molecule microscopy, Harden et al.

We performed single-molecule experiments to measure

For experimental convenience, we did not use core RNAP-DNA complexes that were formed after termination of transcription. Instead, we directly formed sequence non-specific RNAP-DNA complexes by adding core RNAP to a DNA that lacks known promoter sequences. The two types of complexes have the same protein composition and have similar properties: both are long-lived, in both RNAP slides on DNA, both are sensitive to the polyanion heparin

To implement these experiments we designed and synthesized a biotinylated, 3,033 bp circular DNA lacking known promoter sequences that was labeled with the red-excited dye Cy5 (we refer to this construct as

Operon coupling cannot be biologically functional if it takes an infeasibly long time for RNAP to find the secondary promoter after terminating transcription at the terminator of the primary operon. To compute the distribution of search times, we used the experimental results for

Using a combination of theory, stochastic simulations, and single-molecule microscopy experiments, we characterized the potential spatial and temporal reach of transcriptional coupling between adjacent operons mediated by diffusive sliding of RNAP that remains bound to DNA following transcription termination. We predict that

To quantitatively define the reinitiation process, we measured three previously uncharacterized rate constants: the second-order rate constant for binding of

The search for target sequences by proteins sliding on DNA has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo (e.g.,

Rapid, efficient reinitiation of transcription through sliding of post-termination RNAP over relevant genomic distances may have significant implications for transcription homeostasis and regulation in both natural and engineered genomes. Under particular growth conditions, transcription activity is often concentrated in clusters of genes or operons in confined genomic regions
