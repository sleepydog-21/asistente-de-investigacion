Plastics derived from renewable biomass are of interest because they are a potential solution to dwindling and increasingly expensive petroleum resources and have the capacity to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Polylactide (PLA), a representative bio-based plastic, can be chemically synthesized in multiple steps from renewable carbon sources. PLA has a wide range of applications, such as biomedical materials and food-related items. However, the stiffness and brittleness of PLA limit its competitive market expansion.
