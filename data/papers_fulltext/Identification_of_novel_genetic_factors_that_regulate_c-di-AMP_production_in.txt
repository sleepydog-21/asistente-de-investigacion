Secondary messengers are key elements required for an efficient adaptation of bacteria to various environmental conditions, such as soil, plant, animal, or human host environments (

Given the importance of c-di-AMP for viability, growth, and survival under different growth conditions, it is vital for bacteria to tightly regulate the cellular concentration of c-di-AMP. The two main factors that regulate c-di-AMP levels in

Besides GdpP and DacA, not many other factors are known to control c-di-AMP levels in

To identify novel factors regulating cellular c-di-AMP levels, a rapid real-time method for the detection of cellular c-di-AMP levels is required. Currently used methods for the quantification of c-di-AMP in

Here, we constructed and characterized a riboswitch-based c-di-AMP biosensor for

To assess if the decrease in fluorescence using the biosensor is indeed due to an increase in c-di-AMP production, cellular c-di-AMP levels were measured for the WT TM283 strain, the

Increased c-di-AMP amounts are detected in the culture supernatant of several

Since a clear increase in c-di-AMP levels in the supernatant fraction was observed for these five strains following growth in the CDM, additional ELISAs were performed to re-evaluate the cellular c-di-AMP levels using cell extracts prepared from logarithmic as well as stationary phase cultures following growth in CDM. All five strains showed statistically significant and a greater than twofold increase in cellular c-di-AMP levels, either in the log phase (strain
