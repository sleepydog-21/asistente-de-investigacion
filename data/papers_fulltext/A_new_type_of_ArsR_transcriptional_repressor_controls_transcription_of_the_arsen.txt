Arsenic (As) is a toxic metalloid present ubiquitously in the environment. The presence of toxic arsenic species such as inorganic arsenate (As(V)) and arsenite (As(III)) imposes a strong selection pressure for microorganisms to evolve resistance mechanisms

The genes involved in arsenic detoxification are usually organized in

Here, we report a novel



However, phylogenetically, ArArsR forms a cluster that is distinct from other known As(III)‐responsive ArsRs (Figures

We identified an ArArsR‐protected sequence in the promoter region of its own gene as the binding site for ArArsR. The DNase I footprinting and EMSA assays (Figures

In summary, we have identified a new type of As(III)‐responsive ArsR repressor that regulates the transcription of the
