Among the upregulated genes there were operons encoding enzymes for arginine biosynthesis (CCNA_00617–00620), maltose transport (CCNA_02365–02370), and two operons for purine metabolism (CCNA_02687–02690 and CCNA_02699–02701) (

The IscR regulator has been described to bind to distinct DNA sequences when in the apo-or holo-form, showing a [Fe-S] cluster-dependent DNA sequence discrimination (reviewed in

Mapping the IscR-binding sites in the

While several peaks were present in both treatments, we considered peaks with more reads in PYE as sites predominantly occupied by holo-IscR and peaks with more reads in PYE+ DP as sites predominantly occupied by apo-IscR. However, although a 2 h treatment with DP has been shown to lead to iron depletion (

To confirm the ChIP-seq results

The EMSA showed that IscR-His bound to several DNA regions that showed peaks in the ChIP-seq experiment (

IscR binds to regulatory regions of several targets identified by ChIP-Seq.

We identified several relevant genes involved in iron homeostasis and other stress responses as direct targets for IscR binding (

A very interesting result was the IscR binding to the

The genes differentially expressed in the mutant as determined by RNA-seq can be either directly or indirectly regulated by IscR. Twenty-two differentially expressed genes with an IscR binding site upstream identified by the ChIP-seq were considered as being directly regulated. A comparison between the IscR regulon and the Fur regulon (

In this work, we have characterized the IscR regulon, to evaluate the role of IscR in controlling the expression of genes encoding proteins using iron or [Fe-S] clusters as cofactors, as well as others important to iron homeostasis. The important role of [Fe-S] clusters as prosthetic groups in many enzymes has long been recognized, and more recently it was proposed that Fur also binds a [2Fe-2S] cluster (

A summary of the most important effects of IscR and Fur in

Schematic representation of some of the processes regulated by IscR and/or FUR. The effect of the regulator in gene expression is indicated as activation (arrow heads) or repression (blunt heads). Traced lines indicate that the result of the regulation (activation or repression) is unknown. The red and yellow circles symbolize the Fe-S clusters. Note that although IscR is showed without the Fe-S group, it may bind as a holo-protein to some operators. Created in BioRender. Santos, N. (2024)

Interestingly, several IscR-binding sites identified in the ChIP-seq experiment were in regulatory regions where other transcriptional regulators bind (

In some genes the effect is antagonistic, probably by IscR binding interfering with the binding of other regulators (

We observed in the EMSA that IscR binds to the promoter region of the

The FixK regulation by IscR is an important point of intersection between iron homeostasis and oxygen concentration and may be relevant to the diversity of environments faced by this free-living bacterium. The Fix signaling module consists of the two-component phosphorylation system FixL-FixJ, and signal transduction is inhibited by the FixT protein when bound to a [Fe-S] cluster (
