To ensure the sequential utilization of carbohydrates in the environment, most bacteria promote the expression or activity of enzymes and transporters required for the metabolism of a preferred carbohydrate while simultaneously inhibiting the expression or activity of those specific to other carbohydrates. This regulatory mechanism is called carbon catabolite repression (CCR) (

Carbohydrates transported by the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) are usually preferred over those transported by non-PTS (

Besides sugar transport, these PTS components interact with other proteins in a phosphorylation state-dependent manner to regulate bacterial physiology (



Here, we reveal that, in the presence of glucose, dephosphorylated HPr inhibits the FruR-mediated facilitation of the binding of RNAP to the

To examine the phosphorylation state-dependent binding of HPr to FruR, 2 μg of HPr and 8 μg of FruR were incubated with 1 μg of EI and 2 mM PEP or 2 mM pyruvate in buffer P (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0; 2 mM MgCl

The phosphorylation state of HPr was determined as previously described with minor modifications (

The samples for the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were extensively dialysed (two changes, >24 h total) against the ITC binding buffer [20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.0; 100 mM NaCl; 5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine] using SnakeSkin™ Dialysis Tubing with a molecular weight cut-off of 3.5 kDa (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA, #68035). After dialysis, protein concentration was determined by ultraviolet absorbance at 280 nm. For titrations, samples were loaded into a 96-deep-well plate (Malvern Panalytical, Worcestershire, UK, #WEL020854-010) with three consecutive wells filled for a single titration: samples for the reaction cell, the injection syringe and the binding buffer for pre-rinsing the reaction cell (

The sequential utilization of sugars is usually accompanied by the inhibition of genes encoding proteins involved in the metabolism and transport of unfavourable sugars (

Because FruR acts as a transcriptional activator in the presence of fructose and presumably as a weak transcriptional repressor in the absence of fructose in

FruR directly binds to dephosphorylated HPr. (

To further confirm the specificity of the interaction between dephosphorylated HPr and FruR, the binding of the two proteins was examined using native-gel PAGE (

Overall structure of the FruR–HPr complex. (

In a previous study, we reported that the side chains of the conserved residues responsible for F1P binding in VcFruR could be similarly oriented with the corresponding residues in PpFruR (

A common face on HPr interacts with all its partner proteins in

We examined whether these structural features were also present in the VcFruR–VcHPr complex structure. First, Phe48 of VcHPr was forwarded to the F1P binding cavity of VcFruR and positioned near the shallow groove, which is surrounded by hydrophobic residues at the interface between VcFruR and VcHPr (

As mentioned in the previous section, the interaction interface between VcFruR and VcHPr was primarily formed by polar interactions. Two VcFruR–VcHPr interfaces of the heterotetramer (VcHPr–VcFruR::VcFruR′–VcHPr′, where prime denotes the other molecule in the asymmetric unit) share almost identical polar interactions (Figure

The polar interaction is crucial for the FruR–HPr binding. (

As both

Protein–protein interactions can induce structural alterations and regulate the DNA-binding capacity of transcription factors (

The GalR–LacI family transcription factors are important in the coordination of catabolic, anabolic, and transport operons and are widely conserved in prokaryotes (

VcFruR and BsCcpA share a 20.5% amino acid sequence identity (

To explore the mode of HPr binding to FruR or CcpA and the effect of HPr phosphorylation at Ser46 on its binding to partner proteins, we compared the BsCcpA–BsHPr structure (PDB code: 3OQM) (

The FruR–HPr complex structure is distinct from that of the CcpA–HPr complex structure. (

Unexpectedly, the interaction interface between VcFruR and VcHPr is formed at a position different from that of BsCcpA–BsHPr. Amino acids in the loop linking βD and βE (Asp152, Asp153 and Glu154), in the loop linking αIX and βK (Thr313), in the loop linking βE and αIV (Glu162), αIV (Phe164) and αV (Arg195 and Glu196) of VcFruR interact with amino acids in the loop linking β1 and α1 (His15), α1 (Thr16 and Lys27), α2 (Leu47, Phe48 and Gln51), and in the loop linking α2 and β3 (Ser43 and Ser46) of VcHPr (Figure

Here, we show that dephosphorylated HPr directly binds to FruR and inhibits transcriptional activation of the

The EI of the PTS sequentially transfers a phosphate group from PEP to HPr, EIIA and EIIB. If the corresponding PTS substrate is present, EIIB transfers this phosphoryl group to the carbohydrate during its transport through EIIC, leading to a decrease in the phosphorylated state of the corresponding PTS components (
