In this study, we theoretically examined crystallization processes from the LUCA to extant cells. We hypothesize that crystallization was mainly driven by two physical laws (the second law of thermodynamics [

Crystallization of bacteria and archaea. (

Briefly, the possible crystallization process in the origin of bacteria, archaea, viruses, and mobile elements is mainly divided into the following seven stages: (stage 1) from the progenote to the LUCA; (stage 2) the end of the LUCA; (stage 3) enlargement of the DNA genome associated with the “DNA replication divide” and overcoming Eigen’s error catastrophe; (stage 4) formation of coacervate, leading to proto-cells with permeable membranes; (stage 5) evolution of membrane proteins on permeable membranes and the beginning of “Omnis cellula a cellula”; (stage 6) the end of proto-cells with permeable membranes and the beginning of non-free-living cells with non-permeable membranes; and (stage 7) crystallization (emergence of free-living cells with cell walls and co-emergence of viruses and mobile elements).

Based on referenced materials, the current article was developed by outlining the logical sequence in which various biochemical pathways present in existing cells would have emerged as the earliest cells on Earth.

The progenote might have consisted of RNA (

We have previously predicted that a pool of hundreds of single operons associated with both the translation system and extant standard genetic code existed before cells (

We predict that primitive RT can efficiently utilize NTPs as well as dNTPs. Primitive reverse transcriptase, a derivative of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, could polymerize the DNA/RNA-mixed antisense molecule (

Among mixtures of dNTP and NTP, both template and substrate specificities could increase gradually in primitive RT (B) and primitive DdRP (C) by the driving force (D). Furthermore, an unknown mechanism could selectively supply corresponding substrates for primitive RT and primitive DdRP (

Since sense and antisense ssDNAs in duplex DNA share the same physical properties, specific RNA synthesis on antisense DNA, as a template, required promoter sequences. Indeed, extant T7 RNA polymerase (PolB) and bacterial/archaeal RNA polymerase (PolD) cannot discriminate sense or antisense strands of duplex DNA without promoters (

TFIIB may have been the primary promoter recognition protein in the ancient world (

The existence of the Ediacaran biome prior to the Cambrian explosion is indicated by fossils found on Earth. It is presumed that the Ediacaran biome fed on mats composed of microorganisms and is therefore called the garden of Ediacaran due to the lack of predators. We propose that a world consisting of a single population of operons (with the genome configuration defined by Baltimore) before the onset of genome gigantism be compared to the garden of Ediacaran and called the garden of Baltimore. The garden of Baltimore is considered identical to the LUCA.

Crystallization starts from a seed crystal, which is a small piece of a single crystal. If each single operon-type DNA genome in the LUCA (stage 1) corresponds to a seed crystal, enlargement of crystals will require multiple fusions of single-operon-type DNA genomes. Homologous recombination is a key invention to end the LUCA era. Crossing over-mediated homologous recombination helps two operons to fuse. This means that homologous recombination can quickly create larger and more complex genomic structures, leading to the beginning of genetic linkage (

The balance among single operons encoding various products (

In addition to its repair function, extant HR accelerates a variety of genomic rearrangements, including duplications (

Although the

Since each operon represents a different biochemistry (different phenotype), different phenotypes are in linkage due to the linear arrangement of operons, as in the fly chromosome (

Genes associated with different phenotypes could be genetically linked (

The integration of DNA fragments into the genome by HGT under different transcription initiation systems and subsequent mutations in promoter regions was an important process. As shown in

Unlike crystallization of materials, enlargement of DNA genomes corresponding to enlargement of crystals should occur under the physical law of Eigen’s error catastrophe theory [

The replication of large DNA molecules took more time than that required for the replication of small DNA. Accordingly, Mullis-type DNA replication (i.e., the simultaneous replication of both strands) emerged (

High-speed replication fork opening and leading-strand synthesis provided space for lagging-strand synthesis, triggering a two-fold increase in the total replication speed.

Although large crystals made from materials can be cracked into two pieces, two large crystals never fuse. Unlike crystals made from materials, proto-cells (intermediate crystal [stage 5] compared with the first seed crystal [stage 2]) could fuse and split due to the physical nature of DNA and lipids and the biological requirement (Darwinian selection) (
