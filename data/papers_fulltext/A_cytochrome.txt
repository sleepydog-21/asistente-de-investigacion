Many bacteria have flexible and branched respiratory chains that allow them to obtain energy through aerobic and anaerobic respiration under diverse conditions (

Most redox reactions catalyzed by respiratory enzymes involve metal centers containing iron (as heme and iron-sulfur clusters) and copper. The HCO enzymes use a catalytic heme-copper binuclear center. In contrast, the cytbd enzymes contain heme but not copper ions (
