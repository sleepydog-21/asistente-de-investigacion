Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is becoming a leading global health problem, with AMR infections increasing every year

When plasmids are acquired by a new bacterial host, they usually disrupt the cell’s transcriptional profile, and this can translate into a fitness cost

Moreover, there is growing evidence that plasmids may modulate transcriptome changes to manipulate the bacterial host behavior as a strategy to increase their own transmissibility

In this study, we analyzed the transcriptional response associated with carrying plasmid pOXA-48 in 11 MDR enterobacterial strains of four different species isolated from hospitalized patients. Our analyses revealed that pOXA-48 produces variable responses on their hosts, but commonly affects processes related to metabolism, transport, cellular organization and motility. More notably, we demonstrated that a pOXA-48-encoded LysR transcriptional regulator directly increases the expression of a small chromosomal operon in

To study the transcriptional impact of pOXA-48 carriage in clinically relevant bacteria, we analyzed 11 MDR enterobacterial strains isolated from the gut microbiota of patients admitted to a large University Hospital in Madrid, Spain (Supplementary Data

Although the structure and sequence of plasmid pOXA-48 is quite conserved across enterobacteria, we have previously described multiple pOXA-48 variants carrying different indels and/or SNPs

The genetic map of pOXA-48 shows the direction of transcription of genes as arrows, with colors indicating gene function. Each concentric circle of the heatmap represents the expression of pOXA-48 genes of each strain, measured as the median log

Next, we analyzed the expression of pOXA-48 genes in the different genetic backgrounds of the 12 enterobacterial strains. Gene expression was calculated as Transcripts Per Million (TPM). To facilitate comparison between strains, TPM values were normalized by the median chromosomal TPM values of the corresponding strain. All plasmid genes were transcribed (Fig.

pOXA-48 produced variable, strain-specific transcriptomic changes on the chromosome of its enterobacterial hosts (Supplementary Fig.

To find commonly enriched functions between strains, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on the lists of raw DEGs with Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotations (Fig.

Biological Processes (BP) enriched in pOXA-48- carrying enterobacteria. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), correcting for multiple tests with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, was performed on the lists of raw DEGs annotated with Gene Ontology terms for BP (see Methods). Downregulated and upregulated enriched BP are separated in two panels, and are represented by circles. Thicker horizontal lines indicate BP enriched in more than one strain. The size of the circles indicate the ratio of the number of enriched genes of a specific BP by the number of total genes annotated for that BP. The adjusted

pOXA-48 also produced an overall impact in bacterial motility. Genes involved in flagella-dependent motility were strongly downregulated in 2 of the 3

Very few common genes were significantly DE across the strains, and those who were showed different directions of DE (Supplementary Fig.

The complex interactions that occur between plasmids and their hosts shape the evolution of AMR. These interactions can disrupt cellular processes at multiple levels, including the host’s transcriptional regulation. In this work, we explored the impact of the carbapenem-resistance plasmid pOXA-48 on the transcriptomes of 11 MDR enterobacterial hosts. These strains belong to four different clinically relevant species and are natural or sympatric hosts of pOXA-48

A growing number of studies have reported plasmid-chromosome crosstalks mediated by plasmid-encoded regulators

The specific plasmid-chromosome crosstalk described here may be unique to pOXA-48 and the

Bacterial operons usually encode genes sharing similar or complementary biological functions

In summary, our study uncovers a plasmid-chromosome crosstalk that could facilitate the acquisition of carbapenem resistance in one of the most concerning groups of clinical pathogens, MDR enterobacteria. These results highlight, once again, the key role of plasmids as catalysts for bacterial adaptation beyond being mere drivers of horizontal gene transfer

We selected a subsample of MDR strains from the R-GNOSIS collection, recovered in the Ramón y Cajal University Hospital during an active surveillance-screening programme for detecting and isolating ESBL/carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae from hospitalized patients (approved by the Hospital’s Ethics Committee, Reference 251/13
