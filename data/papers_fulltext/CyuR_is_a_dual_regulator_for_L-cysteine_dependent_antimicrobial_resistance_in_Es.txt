The emergence of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria has been recognized as a serious threat to public health

Recently, the production of hydrogen sulfide (H

In this study, we report the effects of Cys and the detailed regulatory roles of CyuR on antimicrobial resistance in

We investigated the effect of Cys on antimicrobial resistance in

To gain an understanding about the increased resistance in response to Cys, we investigated differences in the transcriptome with Cys supplementation in

Inferred iModulon activity changes by 5 mM Cys supplementation. The names of stress-related iModulons are colored in red. The two inset pie charts show the number of functions for iModulons with changed activities. ‘Other’ iModulons were not shown in the bar graph. A full list of iModulons and activities are in Table

From the changed iModulon activities, the effect of Cys supplementation could be inferred. Notably, many iModulons with decreased activities include stress-response related iModulons (e.g., “RpoS” for global stress, “GadXW” for acid stress, and “RpoH” for thermal stress). This observation showed that the Cys supplementation greatly protects bacteria against diverse stress imposed by antibiotics therefore increasing microbial tolerance. Additionally, decreased activities were observed for amino acid metabolism-related iModulons (e.g., “Cysteine-1”, “Arginine”, “Histidine” for their biosynthesis) and energy metabolism-related iModulons (e.g., “microaerobic”, “Fnr-1”). On the other hand, many iModulons with increased activities were related to amino acid metabolism (e.g., “gcvB”), extracellular components (e.g., “FlhDC-1”, “FlhDC-2”, and “FliA-1” for flagella, “Curli-1” for curli, “RcsAB” for colanic acid capsule, “EvgA” for the efflux pumps regulation), and carbon metabolism (e.g., “PlaR” for diketo-L-gulonate, “PaaX” for phenylacetate

We investigated the role of CyuR, which is known to be the major regulator for H

Notably, such improvements by Cys supplementation were lost after deleting

Given its potential expanded regulatory roles in antimicrobial resistance, we further carried out a detailed characterization of CyuR. We first collected existing information about the expression of

We then further explored the regulation by CyuR in

Since there was no predicted transcriptional start site in the intergenic region of

We determined the binding motif of CyuR by investigating a consensus sequence

To confirm the CyuR-binding motif, we conducted a fluorescence polarization assay

We hypothesized that MdlA or MdlB could function as an antibiotic resistance efflux pump because

We investigated the role of MdlA and MdlB using phenotype microarray plates. To test whether MdlA or MdlB can export antibiotics, we took BW25113, BW25113 Δ

Interestingly, when we complemented

We further explored the possibility that CyuR regulates additional target genes by motif scanning of the genome of

Potential regulation targets of CyuR, suggested by motif scanning

In this study, we investigated the effects of Cys supplementation to AMR and its related regulatory network in

Another key finding was the regulatory roles of CyuR for Cys metabolism. We showed that CyuR is required for Cys-dependent resistance for at least nine antibiotics as test cases: demeclocycline, L-aspartic-β-hydroxamate, lincomycin, nalidixic acid, novobiocin, sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole, and sulfathiazole (Fig.

Currently, two opposite effects of Cys on microbial growth have been reported. Although bacteria can increase resistance to growth inhibitors by utilizing Cys, a high level of Cys can be toxic to bacteria
