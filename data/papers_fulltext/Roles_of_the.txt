Pathogens frequently encounter various stressors imposed by host cells, such as iron depletion, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and envelope-damaging agents (

RNAP is an essential transcriptional enzyme. Bacterial core RNAP has five subunits: α

Extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors, the largest and most diverse group of alternative sigma factors, belong to group 4 of the σ

Singlet oxygen, one of the ROS, is the primary agent of photo-oxidative stress in photosynthetic microorganisms. In these microorganisms, singlet oxygen is generated by energy transfer from the excited pigments of the photosystems (



Some stress-alleviation systems contribute to antibiotic resistance (

In-frame deletion mutants were constructed using allelic replacement strategy as described previously (

Tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (tBOOH) and Rose Bengal (RB) were used for the generation of single oxygen. The tBOOH reacts with peroxynitrite to generate singlet oxygen (

RNA was isolated from logarithmical phase bacterial cells and converted to cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time PCR was performed using the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The primer sets used are listed in
