Antibiotic susceptibility of strains studied was examined on MA 2216 plates using commercial paper discs (Research Centre of Pharmacotherapy, St. Petersburg, Russia) impregnated with the following antibiotics (μg per disc, unless otherwise indicated): ampicillin (10), benzylpenicillin (10 U), vancomycin (30), gentamicin (10), kanamycin (30), carbenicillin (100), chloramphenicol (30), neomycin (30), oxacillin (10), oleandomycin (15), lincomycin (15), ofloxacin (5), rifampicin (5), polymyxin (300 U), streptomycin (300), cephazolin (30), cephalexin (30), erythromycin (15), nalidixic acid (30), tetracycline (30), and doxocycline (30). A suspension of cells of the studied strains at a concentration of 0.5 McFarland was applied to a Petri dish with MA 2216 medium, and then discs with antibiotics were placed and incubated at a temperature of 25°C for 48 h.

Description of

Gram-negative, aerobic, oxidase- and catalase-positive, with rod-shaped cells, 0.5–0.8 μm in diameter and 1.2–2.0 μm in length, encapsulated, motile by from 2 to 14 polar and/or lateral flagella. On MA 2216, produces cream-pigmented opaque shining colonies. Growth occurs in 0.5–7% NaCl (optimal is 2–3%) and at 10–32 °C (optimal is 23–25 °C), no growth at 40 °C. The pH range for growth is 5–11 with an optimum of 7.0–8.0.

Negative for hydrolysis of casein and chitin; positive for DNA, starch, tyrosine, gelatin, Tween 20, Tween 40, Tween 80 hydrolysis, H

According to the API 20E test, positive for indole production, ONPG, oxidation of D-glucose, D-mannitol, D-sucrose, amygdalin, reduction of nitrates to nitrites; weak reaction for tryptophane deaminase, L-rhamnose; and negative for arginine dihydrolase, lysine decarboxylase, ornithine decarboxylase, citrate utilization, urease production and H

According to the API 20NE test, positive for indole production, reduction of nitrates to nitrites, hydrolysis of esculin, PNPG, and negative for arginine dihydrolase, urease production, fermentation of D-glucose under anaerobic conditions, assimilation of D-glucose, L-arabinose, D-mannose, D-mannitol, N-acetylglucosamine, D-maltose, D-gluconate, caprate, adipate, L-malate, citrate, and phenylacetate.

According to the API ZYM test, alkaline phosphatase, esterase (C 4), esterase lipase (C 8), leucine arylamidase, acid phosphatase, and naphtol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase activities are present, but valine arylamidase and N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase are weakly active; α-galactosidase, β-galactosidase, β-glucuronidase, cystine arylamidase, α-chymotrypsin, β-glucosidase, α-mannosidase, and α-fucosidase are not active; activities for lipase (C 14), trypsin, α-glucosidase were strain-dependent (the type strain was active for lipase (C 14), weakly positive for α-glucosidase, and not active for trypsin).
