Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are enzymes that produce deoxyribonucleotides, the building blocks of DNA, by reducing ribonucleotides. They can be divided into three classes according to their oxygen requirements: Class I is obligatory aerobic while class III cannot function in the presence of oxygen. Class II RNR is indifferent towards the presence of oxygen. Class I RNR consists of a larger catalytic subunit R1, which is allosterically regulated by different ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides affecting substrate specificity and, in many cases, activity. Catalysis requires a radical that is generated by the smaller subunit R2 and subsequently shuttled to R1

The six metal ligands of R2b are highly conserved in

Here we investigate the distribution of RNR class Ie and the gene neighborhood in R2e encoding organisms. Using X-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry we demonstrate that the QSK R2e variant from the human pathogen

The QSK variant of class Ie RNR is the evolutionary bridge between class Ib and the VPK variant of class Ie as has been shown by Srinivas et al.

The middle of the figure shows a species tree of all species with R2e genes, using the GTDB nomenclature

We could identify 65 species that have the QSK version as their sole RNR. The majority (40) of these are

Strikingly, in virtually all genomes encoding R2e

The presence of over 60 organisms with the class I R2 QSK variant gene as their only RNR strongly suggests that the genes encode a functional RNR and makes it unlikely that they represent inactive gene remnants. The

We analyzed all samples for peptides including position 150 on the protein. For the samples a) (R2 expressed alone) and b) (R2 coexpressed with NrdH) we could detect only peptides containing tyrosine. All samples with NrdI coexpression contained both peptides with tyrosine and DOPA – and no sample contained exclusively modified tyrosine (Fig.

We continued to compare the ratio of DOPA to tyrosine in the samples. In most cases, two different peptides do not have the same ionization efficiency in Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry, and therefore comparing the respective peak intensities (as measured by integrating MS1 signal intensities over the retention time) does not produce a quantitative measurement. However, one can compare the peak intensities in a semiquantitative manner to follow a trend across different samples, obtaining a rough estimation of the amounts of both species.

This comparison showed a surprising trend. First, as shown for R2e

After observing the modification of the crucial active site tyrosine to a DOPA we wanted to examine the activity of the enzyme. To this end, the corresponding R1 from

Each reaction contained R1 and R2.

The protein forms the characteristic ferritin-fold with a bundle of 4 alpha-helices that houses the active site

The active site residues are well-defined. There are no metal ions observed in the active site. Residues Y150, H146, H240 and D112 are in the same position as in other R2bs. The remaining glutamates that usually bind metals in the site are as expected from the sequence substituted to Q143, S203 and K237. The position of Mn1 is occupied by the ε-ammonium group of K237 and in the position of Mn2 a well-defined water is bound (Fig.

This work investigates R2e

Here we show that proteins of the class Ie QSK group evolutionarily bridging the metal-containing class Ib and class Ie VPK and serving as the only aerobic RNRs in several organisms, do indeed form functional RNR systems.

RNR proteins were identified in all species representative genomes from GTDB release 08-RS214

Gene neighbourhoods were identified in the same set of GTDB species representative genomes by identifying RNR genes separated by no more than 300 nucleotides on the same DNA strand.

Several genetic constructs were used in this work; all use the genomic DNA of

The pET28 constructs were selected with kanamycin and the pGEX-4T-1-M with ampicillin/carbenicillin. The appropriate combination of antibiotics was used to ensure successful selection of cells containing the desired plasmids. For each expression, an LB-media (Lysogeny Broth medium) preculture was inoculated with transformant and grown overnight at 37 °C. The following day, large-scale cultures were prepared, 0.5% (vol/vol) of the preculture in 1.6 ml of TB (Terrific Broth medium) supplemented with the correct antibiotics (100 µg/ml carbenicillin and/or 50 µg/ml kanamycin) and 1:10,000 (vol/vol) antifoam 204. The cultures were grown at 37 °C in a benchtop bioreactor system (Harbinger) to an OD

All proteins were purified following a similar protocol as described in Srinivas et al., 2018

Expression of

Both proteins were used in the activity assay as a positive control. The proteins were expressed and purified as described in Srinivas et al.

The five different purifications of R2 were analysed for their metal content. Each purification was measured in triplicate. The proteins were concentrated to about 150 – 600 µM in SEC buffer. As an internal standard, 20 mg/l gallium in distilled water was used; 7 µl of standard was mixed with 7 µl sample. Of the mixture, 10 µl were transferred to a clean siliconized quartz sample carrier and dried on a hot plate. The samples were measured with a Bruker PicoFox S2 spectrometer (Bruker) for 1000 s each. The results were analysed with the Bruker Spectra software version 7.8.2.0 that was provided with the instrument.

Five different protein preparations of similar concentration were analysed by LC-MS. Each sample was prepared in triplicate, so that a total of 15 samples were prepared, and each triplicate was measured three times in LCMS to overcome variations in LCMS sensitivity over time. Approximately 50 µg of protein (or 3 µL of the original protein solution, which had a protein concentration of approximately 400 µM) was used in each individual sample preparation, and samples were diluted in 100 µL of lysis buffer (50 mM Ammonium Bicarbonate buffer pH 7.6, 1 mM Dithiothreitol (DTT)). After heating at 95°C in a heater block with mild shaking for 15 min, samples were allowed to cool down, and 10 µL of 0.04 M chloroacetamide was added (approx. final conc. 4 mM) to alkylate the cysteine residues. Afterwards, potential contaminants were removed using SP3 magnetic beads following a modified version of the SP3 protocol

Briefly, the bottles of Sera-Mag Speed beads (Cytiva P/N 65152105050250 and P/N 45152105050250) were shaken gently until no deposit was observed, and 50 µL was taken from each bead type into one tube. The 100 µL of beads were washed 3x with water (Optima LCMS grade P/N W6-212 from Fisher Scientific) by repeating the following steps 3x: placing the tubes on the magnetic rack, allowing beads to attach for 30 s, removing and discarding all liquid from the beads, taking the tube out from the magnetic rack, and adding 500 µL H

From each sample LC-MS run triplicates (yielding 45 LCMS raw files) were done, the autosampler (Ultimate 3000 RSLC system, Thermo Scientific Dionex) injecting 1 µl into a C18 trap desalting column (Acclaim pepmap, C18, 3 µm bead size, 100 Å, 75 µm × 20 mm, nanoViper, Thermo). After 6 min of flow at 5 µL/min with the loading pump, the 10-port valve switched to analysis mode in which the NC pump provided a flow of 250 nL/min through the trap column. The curved gradient (curve 6 in the Chromeleon software) then proceeded from 3% mobile phase B (90% acetonitrile, 5% DMSO, 5% water, 0.1% formic acid) to 45% B in 50 min followed by a wash at 99% B and re-equilibration. Total LC-MS run time is 24 min longer than the gradient time. We used a nano EASY-Spray column (pepmap RSLC, C18, 2 µm bead size, 100 Å, 75 µm × 50 cm, Thermo) on the nanoelectrospray ionization (NSI) EASY-Spray source (Thermo) at 60°C. Online LC-MS/MS was performed in DDA (data dependent acquisition) mode using a hybrid Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). FTMS master scans with 120,000 resolution (and mass range 300-1500 m/z) were followed by data-dependent MS/MS (60,000 resolution) on the top 5 ions using higher energy collision dissociation (HCD) at 30% normalized collision energy. Precursors were isolated with a 2 m/z window and an isolation offset of 0.5 m/z. Automatic gain control (AGC) targets were 1e6 for MS1 and 1e5 for MS2. Maximum injection times were 100 ms for MS1 and MS2. The entire duty cycle lasted ~1 s. Dynamic exclusion was used with 30 s duration. Precursors with charge states 2-7 were included. An underfill ratio of 1% was used. All chemical reagents are LCMS or Bio ultra-grade and purchased from Sigma Aldrich/Merck unless stated otherwise.

The 45 LCMS raw files were processed in PEAKS Studio 11 (build 20230414, BSI - Bioinformatics Solutions Inc), each file being quantified individually. The enzyme was trypsin, the instrument was Orbitrap (Orbi-Orbi), fragmentation method HCD and acquisition DDA. The processing workflow was a PEAKS Q (de novo assisted Quantification), which began with a Data Refine Step with Chimera feature association, then a Denovo step with a precursor mass error tolerance of 10 ppm, a fragment mass error tolerance of 0.02 Da, carbamidomethylation (C) as fixed modification, and deamidation (NQ) and Oxidation (M) as variable modifications, with a maximum of 3 variable modifications per peptide. There followed a DB search against a concatenated database of 5559 protein entries including sequences from

Measurements for each protein purification were compared against other purification with an unpaired t-test and significant differences were calculated in GraphPad Prism (Version 10.2.2 for MacOS).

All MS raw data and search results files have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD045227.

For the activity assay R1 was mixed in a buffer cocktail containing HEPES pH 8.0, 20 mM magnesium chloride and 25 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). ATP (1 mM) and CDP (2 mM) were used as effector and substrate combination. 50 µl reactions were carried out for all the R1-R2 combinations. R2 was added in the end to start the reaction. Reaction was allowed to carry on for 30 minutes at room temperature, after that 50 µl of 100% methanol was added to stop the reaction. 100 µl of distilled water was added to the mixture. Samples were centrifuged at 20000 g for 5 minutes to remove all the proteins. Finally, 10 µl of the mixture was loaded on HPLC (Agilent) using an Agilent ZORBAX RR StableBond (C18, 4.6 × 150 mm, 3.5 µm pore size) equilibrated with buffer A (10% methanol, 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 10 mM tetrabutylammonium hydroxide). A sample of 10 μL was injected and eluted at 1 mL/min with a gradient of buffer B (30% methanol, 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 10 mM tetrabutylammonium hydroxide). For all assays, 2 µM R1 was used, while R2 concentration was varied between 2 and 4 µM. To generate a radical,

The crystal from the modified protein was collected at the Biomax beamline at MaxIV (Lund, Sweden) and the unmodified protein crystal at the i04 beamline at Diamond Light Source (Oxfordshire, UK). Data was reduced with XDS

For TXRF metal quantification, the five different R2 protein purifications were measured in triplicates and the mean and standard deviation for each purification were calculated. All the measured values, means and standard deviations are presented in Supplementary Table

For LC-MS, three replicates were prepared for each of the five different R2 protein purifications, and each sample was measured in triplicates. The mean and standard deviation were calculated for each sample. Then measurements for each protein purification were compared against other purifications with an unpaired t-test and significant differences were calculated in GraphPad Prism. The means and standard deviations are shown in Fig.
