The default view of how expression of bacterial operons is regulated by physicochemical and nutritional cues includes the action of transcriptional factors (TFs, either activators or repressors) that recognize specifically such signals and in turn either enable or curb transcription of often clustered genes whose products build the physiological response to the upstream inputs (Janga, Salgado, and Martínez‐Antonio

The growing availability of bacterial genomes and transcriptomes has revealed a wealth of naturally occurring regulatory architectures whose evolutionary logic is sometimes difficult to grasp (Stormo and Tan

Herbicide resistance experiments were done in M9 medium with citrate as sole carbon source, supplemented with uracil as mentioned above and added with the concentration the inhibitory compound indicated in each case. Tests were performed by growing strains under examination in 96‐well plates and with biological triplicates and technical duplicates for each condition tested. Similarly, sodium arsenite (NaAsO₂ from Sigma Aldrich Chemicals) was added to the cultures in the same microtitre plate format at the levels marked for each experiment.
