For CRISPR/LbCas12a genome
editing, a gRNA was expressed on pMM002P (p002-218) that targets the

To help speed up the construction of different
genome-edited mutants in parallel, we modified our CRISPR/LbCas12a
toolbox by providing the RF separately as a suicide plasmid. For this
alternative procedure, the CRISPR/LbCas12a cleavage plasmid was cotransformed
with a suicide plasmid containing a promoter–

As an application of our
CRISPR/LbCas12a method, we demonstrated its use as a tool for heterologous
gene integration. We removed the entire ∼8.9 kbp flagellum
operon (

To be ready for a second round of genome editing in the future,
the CRISPR plasmid was removed after genome editing by being counter-selected
on a plate containing 6-azauracil. The absence of the plasmid was
confirmed by the inability of the cells to grow on the medium containing
puromycin, and the removal rate was 9/10.

To expand the gRNA repertoire in our
CRISPR/Cas toolbox, we also
constructed a Cas9-based genome-editing plasmid that uses the
