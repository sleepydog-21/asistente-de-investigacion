To address concerns regarding the microbiological safety of meat, various physical and chemical antimicrobial interventions are implemented at beef plants in North America (

Lactic acid at 4 to 5% is one of the most effective chemical interventions for reducing the microbial load of carcasses, including

The O groups and H types were dispersed across the phylogeny; however, some serotypes clustered in lineages, i.e., O8:H21 and O8:H10 (

The efficacy of the lactic acid treatment depends on its concentration and is also affected by other factors in commercial plants, e.g., the operation condition and bacterial physiological state (

Acid stress induces cellular damage in multiple ways, such as high turgor pressure impairing the stability and activities of enzymes, which disrupts the electron transport chain for cellular repair, leading to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (

The present study found that genes involved in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) degradation (
