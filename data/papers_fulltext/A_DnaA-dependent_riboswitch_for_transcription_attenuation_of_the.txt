Transcription attenuation is a mechanism for transcription termination found in several operons responsible for amino acid biosynthesis

DnaA is the initiator protein for chromosome replication in most bacteria, binding specifically to DNA sequences (DnaA‐boxes) present within the replication origin

Riboswitches serving as molecular switches are regions of mRNA that have specific ligand recognition and binding domains

The His leader RNA and HisL peptide have been suggested to be required for transcription attenuation of the

Next, we sought to clarify the role of DnaA in transcription attenuation. DnaA can also act as a transcription factor, repressing or stimulating the transcription of genes by binding to DnaA boxes (consensus sequence: 5′‐TTA/TTNCACA‐3′)

We investigated the possibility that the DnaA protein might play a direct role in transcription attenuation of the

The DnaA protein binds to HisL‐SL RNA and the absence of rDnaA boxes 1, 2, and 3 compromises DnaA binding and subsequently also transcription attenuation. (A, B) The DnaA protein protects the HisL‐SL RNA and tRNA

Next, we asked if the mutations in rDnaA‐boxes disrupted transcription attenuation in the

Interestingly, in

To assess whether mutations in the rDnaA boxes alter the HisL‐SL RNA secondary structure, we used the Mfold program to predict the secondary structures of mutant HisL‐SL RNA (Figure

The current transcription attenuation model assumes that, in the presence of a specific amino acid, transcription will terminate following the formation of the attenuator stem‐loop, whereas in the absence of the same amino acid, the translating ribosome will stall on the leader mRNA

Here, we present a possibility that attenuation of

Our data also showed that tRNA

In summary, we present a possible novel model for attenuation of

The beads were harvested by centrifugation (1500 rpm for 1 min at 4°C) and washed three times with 1.5 ml of 1× RIPA buffer containing 1 mM PMSF by rotation for 5 min at 4°C and spinning for 30 s. Using the same methods, the beads were washed three times in 1.5 ml of LiCl/detergent solution (10 mM Tris‐HCl pH 8.0, 250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.5% NP‐40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) and three times in 1.5 ml of Tris‐EDTA (TE) (pH 8.0). After removing the supernatant, 300 μl of 0.1 M glycine‐HCl (pH 3.5) was added to the beads, followed by incubation with rotation for 10 min at RT to elute the RNA–protein complex. The supernatant was then collected by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 1 min and transferred to a 0.5‐ml tube containing 30 μl of elution buffer.

The RNA–protein complex was treated with RNase A (7000 units/ml) at 37°C for 1 h, and then incubated at 65°C for 8 h to reverse the cross‐linking. RNA was then immediately isolated using TRIzol reagent (Transgen) following the manufacturer's instructions.

cDNA was synthesized using 300 ng of RNA as a template in a 10‐μl reaction mixture using the PrimeScript first strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (TaKaRa) as described in the manufacturer's protocol, and the cDNA product was detected by electrophoresis.
