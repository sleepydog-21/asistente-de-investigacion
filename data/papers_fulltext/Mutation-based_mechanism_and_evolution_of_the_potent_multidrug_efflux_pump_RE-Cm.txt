The rapid emergence and continued spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria have compromised the efficacy of antibiotics in treating infectious diseases, which has become a public health crisis worldwide (

Recently, a functionally enhanced variant (

Despite the importance of RE-CmeABC in antibiotic resistance, the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms for its emergence and enhanced function remain unknown. Compared to the typical wild-type

Given that there were numerous amino acid changes in RE-CmeABC compared with the typical CmeABC, it was not feasible to analyze their contributions to the enhanced function individually. Thus, we developed a high-throughput method to identify their roles by determining the transferred SNPs in the transformants that gained function in antibiotic resistance. The underlying hypothesis was that the SNPs that are required for the functional gain must be present in all of the transformants that appeared on antibiotic-containing plates. For this purpose, 273 individual transformants (individual colonies) that were selected on MH plates containing 4 µg/ml florfenicol were pooled and their genomic DNA was purified and subjected to whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis by the Illumina MiSeq system. The sequence reads were mapped against the
