Meanwhile, it is clear that

All three Fdh enzymes are membrane-associated, but unlike both respiratory Fdhs, which have their respective active site located on the periplasmic side of the membrane, Fdh-H has its active site located in the cytoplasm, as the enzyme is a component of the multisubunit formate hydrogenlyase (FHL) complex (

In contrast, Fdh-H transfers electrons to a protein within the FHL complex (

What these three Fdhs have in common is their substrate, formate, which, along with acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), is the product of CoA-dependent cleavage of pyruvate by the glycyl-radical enzyme, pyruvate formate-lyase (PflB) (

Rapid, bidirectional translocation of formate between the cytoplasm and the periplasm is a requirement to make this substrate readily available for the three Fdhs, depending on the prevailing growth conditions. For example, when O

Structural analyses of FocA and other FNTs have revealed that the proteins all share a conserved pentameric structure resembling the aqua-glyceroporins (

Other studies have also shown that PflB interacts with the cytoplasmically oriented

Based on the hydrophobicity of the pore, it has been posited that a charged formate anion would be unable to pass through the pore to the periplasm and that only the neutral acid would be able to be translocated (

Exchange of T91 for any other residue except serine also severely hinders formic acid efflux, which indicates that, although channel-like behavior through the pore is observed in the efflux direction, a hydroxylated residue within hydrogen-bonding distance of H209 is a prerequisite to allow passage of formic acid through the pore (

Although the H209 residue is highly conserved across the thousands of members of the FNT family so far identified, a handful of FNTs have either asparagine or glutamine in this position (

Early studies on glucose fermentation by

Notably, residue T91 (or its substitution variant, S91) is also essential for the uptake of formate and hypophosphite by FocA, even when H209 is present. This indicates that the threonine residue is mechanistically involved in the protonation of formate by H209. A mechanism for this reaction has been suggested (

Current data suggest that FocA serves minimally two roles in catabolic formate metabolism. During growth, the first, and likely major, role, functioning together with the FHL-1 complex, is the maintenance of near-neutral intracellular pH during fermentation. This is necessary because of the acidity of formic acid, which is similar to that of lactic acid. Rapid efflux of formic acid to the periplasmic side of the membrane by the channel-like function of FocA alleviates acidification of the cytoplasm and at the same time offers formate as a substrate to the respiratory Fdh enzymes, allowing reduction of any available electron acceptor, i.e., O

The other role of FocA is that of a less rapid secondary transport system for the uptake of formate, either directly from the cellular environment or of the formate that was originally translocated from the cytoplasm to the periplasm. Both of these possibilities have been shown to occur (

How widespread formate as a respiratory energy source is in natural habitats is also becoming clearer with the demonstration of its use as an electron donor by
