The sequences of four plasmids (pSal_238Inf, pSal_249Sch, pESI, and pN17S0349) were annotated using the DDBJ Fast Annotation and Submission Tool (DFAST), and the plasmid structures were drawn and compared using Easyfig (

Next, the short-read sequences of

Two plasmid sequences (pSal_238Inf and pSal_249Sch) and five tentative plasmid sequences (pSal_278, pSal_167, pSal_291, pSal_266, and pSal_256) contained the yersiniabactin biosynthetic, regulatory, and transport operons and the toxin–antitoxin system (

The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of nine antimicrobial agents [ampicillin (breakpoint, 32 μg/mL), cefazolin (8 μg/mL), gentamicin (16 μg/mL), kanamycin (64 μg/mL), tetracycline (16 μg/mL), chloramphenicol (32 μg/mL), nalidixic acid (32 μg/mL), ciprofloxacin (1 μg/mL), and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (4/76 μg/mL)] on the 101 investigated isolates were determined with the broth microdilution method using Frozen Plate (Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). In addition, the MICs for streptomycin (16 μg/mL) (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Co., Osaka, Japan) and trimethoprim (16 μg/mL) (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Co.) were determined using the agar dilution method in Mueller–Hinton agar (Thermo Fisher Scientific K. K., Osaka, Japan), according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines [

The major genes for resistance to streptomycin [

To determine the inserted gene cassettes in the class 1 integron, the corresponding regions in each isolate were classified using RFLP analysis, as previously described [

Next, conjugation experiments were performed using the broth mating method to determine the transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes. A rifampicin-resistant

The agar dilution method was used to determine the MICs of ampicillin, cefazolin, streptomycin, kanamycin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim for the transconjugants. The antimicrobial resistance genes in the transconjugants were also detected via PCR, as described above.
