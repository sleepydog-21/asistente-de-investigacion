We show in this study that a constitutively active variant of RecA, RecA730, activates high levels of RtcR-dependent expression from

We previously found that RtcR-dependent expression of the RNA repair operon in

To address whether the signal that activates RtcR is a direct product of the nucleic acid-damaging agent or is generated by a RecA-dependent cellular process associated with the response to DNA damage, a plasmid was constructed that expresses a variant of RecA based on the

We considered whether RecA may not be responsible for signal generation but, rather, may be important for some other aspect of RtcR functionality, such as binding enhancer sites or interacting with the RpoN-holoenzyme. To address this, we expressed a constitutively-active RtcR variant (RtcR

We previously found that genotoxic conditions that activate the RNA repair operon in

In order to determine whether the involvement of RecA in RtcR activation is through its interactions with the LexA repressor, we assayed for transcription from

RtcR-dependent activation of the RNA repair operon in mutants that target SOS response pathways and functions identified as involved in RtcR activation in a genome-wide mutagenesis screen.

To address the RecA*-induced Gifsy-1

A possible mechanism whereby deletion of STM14_3218-3220 may affect the readout of the reporter is destabilization of the plasmid used in the reporter system. To test this possibility, MMC was used to initiate activation conditions in the XylE assay, instead of expression of RecA730 from pJK15. The ΔSTM14_3218-3220 reporter strain still exhibited significantly reduced expression of XylE relative to the WT strain under activation conditions (13-fold; Fig. S6). This result demonstrates that the observed phenotype for deletion of STM14_3218-3220 in Gifsy-1 is not due to an effect specifically of RecA730 versus WT RecA nor an effect of the STM14_3218-3220 region on the copy number or segregation of the RecA730-expression plasmid.

To assess whether heterologous expression of STM14_3218-3220 could be utilized to further define the function(s) from this region required for RtcR activation, complementation of the ΔSTM14_3218-3220 reporter strain by STM14_3218-3220 expression from the arabinose-inducible

For a more global approach to determining all genetic factors that account for the strain-specific differences in RtcR activation, we developed a screen for horizontal transfer of the

To confirm the 14028s genetic locus that determines strain-specific differences in RtcR activation, we assayed the frequency of cotransduction of KanR with the RtcR activation phenotype (Lac+) into strain LT2, as well as strain 4/74, using as donor strains the 4/74-14028s chimeric strains and selected 14028s single-gene deletion (SGD) mutants (

Directed mutagenesis of key genes in each of the LexA-controlled SOS-response DNA-repair pathways revealed that none of the repair pathways are essential for RtcR activation (

While the Gifsy-1 STM14_3218-3220 region was identified as the essential prophage-specific determinant, Gifsy-3 also contributes to the RtcR signaling pathway in strain 14028s, as evidenced by the 1.8-fold downregulation of expression from

In addition to processes that are dependent upon RecA*, we identified a bacterial gene that is not directly regulated by RecA but plays an essential role in RtcR-dependent activation of

Overall, this study identified essential bacterial and bacteriophage components of a RecA*-LexA-controlled pathway for activation of the RtcR transcriptional regulator of RNA repair genes in

For XylE reporter strains transformed with pJK15 (RecA730 expression vector), cultures were grown overnight from a single colony inoculated in LB plus Tet plus 0.2% glucose (to repress the plasmids) and subcultured to an optical density at 600 nm (OD

To generate RtcR activation conditions in XylE assays with reporter strains that did not contain pJK15 (RecA730), MMC treatment was used. The cultures were prepared as described above with the appropriate antibiotics for any plasmids carried by the reporter strains; one of each of the split cultures at mid-log phase were treated with 3 μM MMC. After 90 min of growth, the MMC-treated and untreated cultures were assayed for XylE activity.
