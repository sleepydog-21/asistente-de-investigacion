Analysis of plasmids obtained from the PLSDB (version 2023_11_23_v2, containing 59 895 plasmid records) revealed the presence of

Type II HicAB and StbDE TAs are enriched on IncI2-type

Interestingly, unlike the

Plasmid-encoded TA systems were initially proposed to ensure the vertical inheritance of plasmids by eliminating cells devoid of the plasmid post-segregation. Hence, we tested the capability of the two pairs in stabilizing exogenous pCA24N, a high-copy expression plasmid under relaxed copy number control that would generate plasmid-free cells in the K-12 host without selection pressure after continuous cultivation. As expected, both HicA

Therefore, we next pursued more physiologically-relevant conditions to investigate plasmid stability and the physiological role of these two TA systems on the p45 plasmid. Since the wild-type (WT) p45 is maintained at approximately one copy per cell in the K-12 host, we constructed deletions to knock out each toxin gene and each TA pair from p45. In the absence of polymyxin B (PB), the p45 plasmid was stably maintained at approximately one copy per cell in K-12, indicating that the replication and segregation of p45 are under stringent control. In addition, the mutant plasmids p45Δ

HicAB and StbDE are both dispensable for the vertical stability to the p45 plasmid. (

In parallel, to explore the role of StbDE in plasmid–plasmid competition, we employed conjugative transfer to obtain the strain K-12/p45: p45Δ

Next, we aimed to investigate why HicAB and StbDE differ in how they impact plasmid competition. For type II TAs, the TA operon is usually cotranscribed with the antitoxin gene preceding the toxin gene [

Next, according to the above study, the two TA systems are expected to contribute to p45 fitness during bacterial competition via plasmid conjugation and

Bacteria carrying the p45 plasmid emerge as victors during bacterial competition. (

Horizontal transfer is a critical process for conjugative plasmids; TA-mediated plasmid competition can thus function in the exclusion of competing plasmids via toxin-based toxicity. In addition, from the perspective of TA modules, this plasmid competition also functions to promote the spread of a specific family of TA modules within the population. In the case of p45 plasmids,

In this study, we investigated the functions of two TA systems individually encoded by
