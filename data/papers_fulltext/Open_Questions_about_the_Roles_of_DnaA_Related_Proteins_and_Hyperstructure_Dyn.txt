The coordination of cell growth and chromosome replication is achieved by mechanisms that are still being uncovered. One approach to investigating this coordination is genetics and, over the last half century, this has led to the isolation of conditional lethal mutants of cell division or DNA synthesis. As part of these investigations, in early 1960, Kohiyama started to isolate mutants of

The first priority was the elucidation of the regulatory mechanism of chromosome replication as hypothesized in the Replicon Theory [

Further characterization of these

In fact, the possibility that DnaA protein acts as a regulator of gene expression was raised by Hansen a few years after the isolation of the first mutant [

To explore this proposal, it is essential to characterise the biochemical properties of the DnaA protein. A large part of this was done by Kornberg and his collaborators using genetic engineering only 20 years after the first isolation of a

Hyperstructures are large assemblies of molecules and macromolecules that have particular functions; they constitute a level of organization intermediate between the macromolecule and the cell. We have refrained from defining the concept too precisely because it is still “under development” and a prematurely narrow definition might limit its usefulness. In doing this, we adopt the principle of using a “generous Darwinian fog” [

Here, we raise questions that need to be addressed to clarify the roles of DnaA and related proteins in the cell cycle. We do this in the theoretical framework of hyperstructure dynamics and in the context of an origins-of-life scenario in which the early cells or

We propose that the precursors of cells,

Biomolecular condensates are a class of hyperstructures that play major roles in prokaryotic and eukaryotic physiology (for a review see [

The chromosomal

After initiation, the ATPase activity of DnaA is stimulated by the regulatory inactivation of the DnaA (RIDA) complex composed of the Hda protein interacting with the DNA-loaded β-clamp [

DnaA is also a sequence-specific transcriptional regulator. Such regulators bind to sites that are distributed on the chromosome with a periodicity consistent with a solenoidal-type organization [

The involvement of the membrane in the initiation of replication has long been known [

Metabolism is coupled to DNA synthesis through nutrient richness and growth rate in a variety of ways. One way this occurs is via (p)ppGpp [

Given that metabolic enzymes can exist as hyperstructures in their own right, a question that arises here is whether metabolic enzymes are also part of an initiation hyperstructure. And a related question is whether the metabolites themselves are directly part of initiation and/or replication hyperstructures, not just by binding to the constituent proteins (as in the case of DnaA and cAMP [

Kornberg’s group first showed that DnaA opens

Strick’s group performed a single molecule analysis on DnaA–

Techniques based on minicircles of DNA facilitate the detection of fine-scale modifications to the DNA structure. Using an

This work raised the question of whether or not the ATP-dependent opening of

In the strand segregation hypothesis, a coherent phenotypic diversity is generated by the segregation of certain hyperstructures with only one of the parental DNA strands [

It has been proposed that a hyperstructure might be assembled if enzymes (such as protein kinases and acetyltransferases) and their NAP substrates were to associate with one another in a positive feedback loop in which, for example, the modification of an NAP by its cognate enzyme increases the probability of colocation of both the NAPs and the enzyme [

DnaA binds cAMP with a Kd of a similar order to that with which it binds to ATP; indeed, the affinity of DnaA for cAMP is such that most of the cell’s DnaA should be bound to cAMP when the latter is present at the physiological concentration of 1 µM [

In the case of

Fralick found that the timing of initiation and the number of replicating chromosomes per cell (and the DNA/mass ratio) could be varied independently of one another in a temperature-sensitive

The macromolecular synthesis (MMS) operon is highly conserved [

DNA replication is clearly coupled to cell division, insofar as signalling systems exist to prevent division when DNA has been damaged [

In

It may be significant that the above anucleate cell production also requires cAMP (via either the activity of the wild type

It could also be argued that it would have made sense for the earliest protocells to have had the same signalling mechanism leading to both DNA replication and cell division. This is because the RNA and/or DNA in these protocells was probably short and, in the

Oscillations in the speed of the replisome along the

The supercoiling state of chromosomal DNA varies according to the growth phase and to extracellular stresses such as osmotic shock, heat, pH, and antibiotics [

The initiation and elongation steps of chromosome replication are tightly coordinated and mutually dependent in all organisms: the inhibition of initiation results in an increase in elongation rates and vice versa [

The pool of available dNTPs is critical for successful replication since, with a defective supply, the DNA is likely to be damaged. Decreases in the size of the dNTP pool result in increases in the C period and

The question then is whether RNR must be functioning for initiation to occur—and, possibly, functioning in the right place? Put differently, could RNR act as a sensor—or allow the initiation hyperstructure to act as a sensor—in order to couple metabolism and cell growth with replication? If so, could the very activity of RNR determine its presence in the initiation hyperstructure and the ability of this hyperstructure to trigger replication, as proposed for functioning-dependent structures [

The rate of replication fork movement in all organisms depends on the activity of the enzyme RNR, which controls the level and balance of dNTP pool sizes during DNA synthesis (the S phase in eukaryotes and the C period in bacteria). The rate of replication fork movement also depends on a number of other factors, including the lagging strand DNA polymerase DnaE in

As noted above, initiation in

Cells with reduced dNTP levels, however, initiate DNA replication earlier in the cell cycle (immediately after cell division) compared to wild type cells, but at a relatively larger cell size and hence at the same initiation mass [

The independence of the initiation mass from the cell growth rate strongly suggests a metabolic link to the signalling of replication initiation, a link that remains poorly elucidated to date. In eukaryotes, DNA synthesis takes place during the reductive (biosynthetic) phase of the cell cycle and coincides with an abrupt rise in reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the G1 oxidative phase/ S phase transition, which suggests that the cellular metabolic state plays a role in signalling the timing of initiation at a critical cell physiology/mass, at least in eukaryotes [

It is tempting to speculate that levels and balances in metabolite pool sizes play a significant regulatory role in signalling and controlling important cell cycle processes, such as the accumulation of the initiation mass, the timing of the initiation of DNA replication, the rate of chromosome elongation, and cell division. Clearly, these events are tightly coordinated and co-regulated. One way is via post-translational modifications such as the acetylation of DnaA (see above

Eberle and collaborators performed a series of experiments that largely entailed shifting a growing culture of a

Eliasson and Nordstrom used an integratively suppressed strain to investigate minichromosome replication [

L-forms are bacteria that manage to grow in the absence of a peptidoglycan layer. They can be obtained by different methods and can have different styles of growth [

The principles of molecular biology have been to isolate and characterise gene products. The success of this reductionist approach has laid the foundations for the complementary, integrative approach based on physics and physical chemistry that shows how these products interact. This is the approach to the bacterial cell cycle that we have adopted here. Jun and collaborators recently proposed a variant of the initiation-titration model [

Our approach has been to ask what problems confront systems in general when they must adapt to an environment so as to profit from opportunities for growth and yet survive stresses: this balancing act is “life on the scales”, by which we mean that cells are constrained by selective pressures to balance apparently incompatible requirements (e.g., to both grow and not grow) and, hence, to find apparently incompatible solutions (e.g., to invest in both non-equilibrium structures and equilibrium structures) [

Once a regulatory system with many interactions between essential components has been constructed, it is well-nigh impossible to replace it completely. With this, and with the above criteria in mind, we have tried to formulate hypotheses for the regulation of the cell cycle that can be grounded in a plausible origins-of-life scenario [

In the context of a physico-chemical approach based on hyperstructures, we have tried here to frame questions about the actors in the regulation of the cell cycle of modern bacteria. The principal actor in the initiation of chromosome replication is DnaA. The sorts of questions that, therefore, need answering include whether there are chromosomal hyperstructures that depend on DnaA binding to its different sites in the origin, in DARS, in

At a still deeper level, the fundamental question is whether the initiation of cell cycle events involves a dialogue between separate hyperstructures (e.g., via the exchange of molecules and macromolecules) or whether this initiation involves a single hyperstructure undergoing changes in structure and composition (or both …). Answering this question may require the development of new techniques, for example by using
