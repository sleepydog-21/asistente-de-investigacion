Enterococci, residents of the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts, are notorious for causing a variety of opportunistic infections including but not limited to catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) (

While not exhaustive, previous studies have investigated microbial interactions of enterococci (

Biofilm assays were performed as previously described with minor modifications (

Bacteria were grown overnight in MRS media, adjusted to an OD

The Wizard DNA purification kit (Promega, Wisconsin, USA) was used to obtain genomic DNA from single-species or dual-species macro-colony pellets (prepared in triplicates). Samples were submitted to the University of Minnesota Genomics Center for library preparation and sequencing. Sequencing was performed using an Illumina NextSeq 2000 in 150 bp paired-end output mode. Tn-seq analysis was performed with custom scripts using the University of Florida supercomputer HiperGator. Analysis of sequencing reads was performed as previously described (

Data obtained from this study were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 9.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA). Data from multiple experiments conducted on non-consecutive days were collated and applicable statistical tests were used.
