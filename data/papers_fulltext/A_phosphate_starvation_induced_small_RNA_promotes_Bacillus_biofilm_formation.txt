Phosphorus (P) is the fifth most abundant element (after C, H, O, and N) on earth and is essential for the growth of all organisms, including microbes. In the natural environment, microorganisms often encounter inorganic phosphorus (Pi) limitation

Biofilms, which are highly structured aggregates formed by microorganisms at two-phase interfaces, are the prevalent form of bacterial communities in nature

In a previous study, we detected a putative sRNA encoded in the intergenic region (IGR) between

PhoS accumulates when cells enter the stationary phase in each of the four different media that we tested (8 and 10 h, Fig.

To confirm that

Sequence alignment revealed that

To determine functional roles of PhoS, we first performed studies using the

To test this inference in

We also made assays under other conditions using different media, different temperatures, and different strains (

To understand how PhoS promotes biofilm formation, we conducted transcriptome analysis of wild-type FZB42 and the ∆

We conducted additional experiments to examine the impact of PhoS on the production of EPS in FZB42 and DK1042. Our findings revealed that disrupting

Having unraveled that PhoS has a role in biofilm formation, we are equally intrigued by the mechanisms governing the regulation of PhoS. The proximity of

Salzberg et al. reported that the 3’ UTR of

To validate this interaction, we determined the transcription start site (TSS) of

Additionally, we examined the transcriptome data showing the effect of PhoS on FZB42 gene expression (Supplementary Table

To better understand how the interaction between PhoS and the

We also predicted the interaction between PhoS and the 5’UTR of

We also investigated the interaction between PhoS and

In this study, we identified PhoS, a 3’UTR-derived sRNA that is induced in expression by environmental phosphate deprivation while regulating biofilm formation in

The expression of PhoS requires the transcriptional regulator PhoP, whose translation is promoted by PhoS, which forms an autoregulation loop. PhoP binds to the promoter regions the

However, while it is straightforward to understand the regulation of biofilm formation by PhoS through teichuronic acid biosynthesis, we do not exclude the possibility that other targets of PhoS or other regulatory circuits are also involved. For example, in the PhoP regulon there are more genes which can influence biofilm formation. One is the gene

Currently, we do not know to what extent each of these pathways contributes to the regulation of biofilm by PhoS. We speculate that the signaling pathway mediated by surfactin, Spo0A~P and SinI may be important because it can directly stimulate the expression of the

Within the PhoP regulon, PhoP represses three genes (

Notably, the impact of

Overnight bacterial cultures were diluted with their corresponding media to an OD

We followed a protocol as previously reported

For each strain, three colonies were randomly selected for preculture overnight and were then adjusted to the same concentration before being inoculated (1%, v/v) into new media for incubation. For visualization and analysis of GFP fluorescence from bacterial colonies, the FluorChem Q imager was used with the excitation light set at 475 nm for excitation and emission light collection at 537/26 nm. For measurement of GFP fluorescence from liquid culture, one mL of bacterial culture was transferred to a 24-well plate, and fluorescence was quantified using a spectrophotometer (Varioskan Flash, Thermo, USA) with excitation at 480 nm and emission at 509 nm. In most cases, the GFP fluorescence intensity of different cultures was directly plotted for comparison since their optical density values at 600 nm (OD
