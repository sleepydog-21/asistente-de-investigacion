Cell association and invasion phenotypes of

To evaluate the role of type 1 and type 3 fimbriae of KqPF9 in cultured bladder epithelial cell association, we generated strains with targeted deletions of

Because variation in urovirulence phenotypes has been previously reported in

Expression of type 1 and type 3 fimbriae as well as bladder epithelial cell attachment and biofilm formation is elevated in KqPF9 relative to TOP52. (A and B) qRT-PCR analysis of type 1 fimbriae (

We next used previously generated whole-genome sequences of TOP52 and KqPF9 to identify genotypic differences explaining the increased expression of

The FimK C-terminal PDE is truncated in

Before investigating differences in FimK function between KqPF9 and TOP52, we first sought to determine if known regulators of type 3 fimbrial expression, MrkH and MrkJ, functioned similarly in

The role of

To evaluate the role of the C-terminal PDE domain of FimK in the regulation of type 3 fimbriae expression, we generated TOP52

TOP52

Considering that only expression of the

Both type 1 and type 3 fimbriae have been reported to mediate host cell attachment and invasion by

The regulatory mechanisms controlling the expression of type 1 and type 3 fimbriae in

The observed requirement for type 3 fimbriae for

Interestingly, we found that deletion of

It is also possible that additional regulatory differences exist between the two species that may contribute to differences in expression of type 1 and type 3 fimbriae. In addition to local regulators of type 1 and type 3 fimbriae encoded within the

Taken together, the data presented here provide new insight into the regulation of type 3 fimbriae by

Bacterial strains and plasmids used in the study are listed in

Strains and plasmids used in this study

Cell association and invasion assays were performed as previously described (

Type 1 fimbriae knockout, type 3 fimbriae knockout, or both type 1 and type 3 fimbriae knockout mutants of

For the construction of complementation plasmids, genes were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using Dreamtaq Mastermix (ThermoFisher) or PHUsion polymerase for PCR products >2,000 bp (NEB) with respective primers as provided in Table S2. For all plasmids, NcoI and HindIII restriction sites were used except for plasmids encoding

Transformation of

Total RNA was extracted from respective statically growing

Static biofilm assays were performed as described previously (

Bacterial strains were grown overnight at 37°C in Luria Bertani (LB) media at static conditions. Cultures were normalized to an OD

Red blood cells (RBCs) were isolated via centrifugation of fresh whole human blood (Fisher). Briefly, whole blood was centrifuged at 1,000 ×

Agglutination assays using tannic acid-treated human RBCs were performed as described previously (

The

Negative staining and electron microscopy were performed as previously described (

All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (9.1.0). For pairwise comparisons, significance was evaluated by paired two-tailed Student’s
