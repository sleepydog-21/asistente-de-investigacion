The ubiquitous transcription elongation factors GreA and GreB, henceforth jointly named Gre factors, small cytoplasmic proteins of <20 kDa, have been extensively studied in

Mutant alleles were transduced into a novel strain background by phage P22 HT/int4 [

For biofilm on glass, qualitative assays were performed as described [

Cultures were grown on LB

Qualitative assessment of bacterial cellulose production was determined on LB

The rdar morphotype was judged visually on Congo red agar plates (LB

Immunodetection of CsgD was performed as described [

RNA was isolated from cultures grown on LB

Differences between average values were tested for significance by performing an unpaired two-sided Student’s test. The levels of significance of the resulting

The production of the two extracellular appendages, curli and cellulose, which are promoting cell–cell, cell–interface and cell–surface interactions in

Notably, the Gre-mediated control of curli and cellulose expression was further confirmed by successful restoration of the rdar morphotype in a ∆

In order to determine if the Gre factors are required for

These results also clearly indicate that the 5′-UTR is required for Gre-mediated stimulation of

These data indicate that the 5′-UTR of the

Gre factors promote transcription elongation by resolving backtracking of paused transcription complexes [

Rdar and alternative modes of biofilm formation are delicately regulated. The switch between planktonic and sessile (biofilm) cells denotes not only a radical change in the single cell versus population behavior, but also in the physiology and metabolism of the organism. In

In this report, we describe the Gre factors as new players in the array of regulators affecting

In a previous report, we described in

Long 5′UTR are regulatory motifs often involved in post-transcriptional regulation by very diverse mechanisms and targets for regulation at the level of transcription elongation [
