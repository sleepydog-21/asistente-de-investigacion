The meningococcus has been proposed to be on an evolutionary trajectory as an aerobe in the oxygen-rich nasopharyngeal niche (

Bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table S1 of supplemental material. CNM3 served as the representative of

RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed as described in Tzeng et al. (

For the PCR linkage analysis of the operon, cDNA samples were obtained by reverse transcription of total RNA (0.5 Âµg) using the Maxima H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher) with CTS281 or ispF-qR1 as the primer. PCR was performed on the cDNA samples with the primer combinations listed in

All primers used for the genetic manipulation are noted in Table S2 in the supplemental material. A fragment upstream of
