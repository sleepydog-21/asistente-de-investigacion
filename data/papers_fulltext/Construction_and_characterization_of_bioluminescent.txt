In this study, we aimed to develop and characterize two bioluminescent strains of

Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study

While the SRO strain is resistant to ampicillin and sensitive to chloramphenicol, the SRN strain is sensitive to both antibiotics. Consequently, the bioluminescence expression vector plasmid pBS-

The bioluminescence marker gene enables bacteria to emit light, which is detectable through bioluminescent imaging. The bacterial lux gene (lux operon) utilized in this study originates from a naturally occurring bacteria, called

Several bacterial species have been tagged with the bacterial lux operon,

This research shows the efficacy of tagging foodborne pathogens with bioluminescence genes, as well as bioluminescent imaging as a breakthrough method that can be used for easy tracking and monitoring pathogens in poultry and poultry products. The constructed bioluminescent
