To investigate the response selectivity, the overnight cultures of TOP10/pPb-vioABDE were diluted at 1:100 in fresh LB medium and exposed to 1.5 μM various metal ions, including Pb(II), Cr(III), Hg(II), Zn(II), Mg(II), Ni(II), Mn(II), Ca(II), Fe(II), Cd(II), and Cu(II). To assess the influence of various metal ions on the response of TOP10/pPb-vioABDE toward Pb(II), target Pb(II) was mixed with various interference metal ions at 1.5 μM and exposed to biosensor cells.

Lead salt was spiked into four environmental water samples: pure water, tap water, lake water, and soil extracts. The response of PV-based biosensors toward bioaccessible Pb(II) in the environmental matrices was investigated. Environmental surface water and surface (0–20 cm) lateritic soil samples were collected from a local park (Luohu District, Shenzhen, China). Air-dried soil samples (10 g) were fully suspended using 200 mL of pure water and vortexed for 1 h. After being placed at 26°C for 5 h, the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 μM filter. The LB medium was freshly prepared by mixing 90% v/v filtered purified water, tap water from our laboratory, ambient surface water, and soil extract with 10% v/v 10 × LB broths. Overnight cultures of TOP10/pPb-vioABDE were diluted at 1:100 in four media. A double dilution method was used to obtain 3,000, 1,500, 750, 375, 187.5, 93.8, 46.9, 23.4, 11.7, 5.86, 2.93, and 0 nM Pb(II) exposure groups for non-oxidation treatment, and 6,000, 3,000, 1,500, 750, 375, 187.5, 93.8, 46.9, 23.4, 11.7, 5.86, 2.93, 1.46, 0.732, 0.366, 0.183, 0.0915 and 0 nM Pb(II) exposure groups for oxidation treatment. After incubation at 37°C for 5 h, bacterial density and dual-color signals were determined at 600 nm and 652 nm, respectively.

In conclusion, this study transformed an intermediate of the branched violacein biosynthetic pathway into a dual-color biosensing reporter. The PV-derived dual-color signals had excellent biosensing properties and showed great potential in developing whole-cell biosensors toward pollutants such as toxic Pb(II). Colored signals read directly by the naked eye enabled a PV-based biosensor, a potential on-site detection method. The sensitivity and selectivity of bacterial biosensors are expected to be improved by optimization of genetic circuits and molecular evolution of metalloregulator PbrR in future studies.
