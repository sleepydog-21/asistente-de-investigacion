Retrieval of high-quality genomes from metagenomes is a step towards creating niche-specific databases, which are needed in host-associated environments to understand the microbiome composition and functional capacity in health and disease, and better assess the impact of microbiome modulation strategies. We combined long-read nanopore metagenomics and Hi-C (high-throughput chromosome conformation capture) proximity ligation data as a proof-of-concept to retrieve metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the canine gut. Long-read metagenomics retrieves long contigs harbouring complete assembled ribosomal operons, antibiotic-resistance genes, prophages and other mobile genetic elements. Hi-C allowed the binning of the long contigs into high-quality MAGs (HQ MAGs) and medium-quality MAGs, some of them representing closely related species. Moreover, Hi-C also linked plasmids to their bacterial host. HQ MAGs improve the short-read MAGs of public datasets. Long-read metagenomics combined with proximity ligation binning is likely to become a comprehensive approach for the discovery of MAGs, which are essential to unravel the biological role of microbial members in multiple environments, such as the canine gut.

An overview of the scripts used to analyse the data is available as Supplementary material (available with the online version of this article). The final CanMAGs (canine metagenome-assembled genomes) are available on Zenodo:

The human gut microbiome has been extensively studied using metagenomics, and large catalogues of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) are available to represent genomes of uncultured bacteria [

The quality of the retrieved MAGs is assessed following the MIMAG standard criteria [

The fields of veterinary medicine and nutrition have an increasing interest in the composition and function of the canine gut microbiome [

Long-read metagenomics uses long DNA stretches, solving many issues derived from short-read MAGs. Long-read sequencing spans complete ribosomal genes and their genomic context, bridging together microbiome insights obtained by short-read MAGs and 16S rRNA sequencing surveys [

However, long-read sequencing needs to overcome two main issues: extracting long DNA fragments and reducing the sequencing error rate. For the first, high-molecular-weight DNA extractions suited for sample type work efficiently producing long reads, as previously demonstrated for faecal samples [

To further disentangle complex microbiomes, metagenomics can be complemented with high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) proximity ligation data. Hi-C proximity ligation cross-links DNA

In this context, our main objective was to evaluate nanopore long-read metagenomics and Hi-C proximity ligation to provide HQ MAGs as representatives of the canine gut environment. We retrieved 27 HQ MAGs and 7 MQ MAGs harbouring complete ribosomal genes, MGEs and prophages as well as ARGs from a single sample, increasing the number of our previous canine MAGs (CanMAGs) [

Our study focuses on the microbiome analysis of a single faecal sample of a healthy dog. Using the same faecal sample, we extracted high-molecular-weight DNA with a Quick-DNA HMW MagBead kit (Zymo Research) and non-high-molecular-weight DNA with a DNA miniprep kit (Zymo Research). We prepared a sequencing library for each DNA extraction using the Ligation Sequencing kit 1D (SQK-LSK109; Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and sequenced each of them in a flowcell R9.4.1 using MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). After the two nanopore runs, we obtained a total of 16.94 million reads (36.05 Gb). Further details have been described previously [

The same faecal sample was used to generate a Hi-C library using the ProxiMeta Hi-C kit following the manufacturer’s protocol (Phase Genomics). The Hi-C method cross-links DNA molecules that are in close physical proximity within intact cells. Hi-C libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform, generating 75 bp paired-end reads. The Proximeta Hi-C library produced 75.01 million paired-end reads (11.40 Gb).

Raw fast5 files from nanopore sequencing were basecalled using Guppy 3.4.5 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) with high accuracy basecalling mode (dna_r9.4.1_450bps_hac.cfg). During the basecalling, the reads with an accuracy lower than seven were discarded. Before proceeding with the metagenomics assembly, we performed an error-correction step of the raw nanopore reads using canu 2.0 [

We further corrected the metagenomic bins by correcting the frameshift errors, as described elsewhere [

To assess the novelty and the taxonomy of the metagenomic bins, we used GTDB-tk 1.3.0 [

We used Prokka 1.13.4 [

We compared the HQ MAGs obtained to previously reported MAGs from the most extensive and recent gastrointestinal collections: (i) the animal gut metagenome [

We assessed the metagenomic bins representing HQ MAGs and MQ MAGs with <5 % contamination for any putative plasmids. The putative plasmids within the HQ MAGs and MQ MAGs were predicted using Plasflow 1.1.0 [

To perform vConTACT2, we used a subset of the Gut Phage Database (GPD) [

We characterized the faecal metagenome of a healthy dog by combining a nanopore long-read metagenomics assembly with Hi-C proximity ligation data, and retrieved a total of 27 HQ MAGs and 7 MQ MAGs, according to the MIMAG criteria. We named the 34 MAGs described in this study as CanMAGs. The long reads provided long contigs that harboured non-collapsed repetitive regions, complete ribosomal genes, ARGs and MGEs. Hi-C data allowed the binning of these long contigs to create HQ MAGs and MQ MAGs. Five out of the 34 CanMAGs were single-contig genome assemblies, so they needed no Hi-C data for binning. The long contigs harboured 50 prophages, and the Hi-C data linked the 6 plasmids to their bacterial host. We did not describe free viral particles.

We retrieved 34 CanMAGs from the faeces of a healthy dog, which were – according to the MIMAG criteria [

Boxplots represent the distribution of the number of ribosomal genes (left) and contigs (right) for the bacterial species identified in this study. Other quality parameters assessments are detailed in Table S1. For each bacterial species, the best genome assembly available on public datasets was included for comparison. Representative genomes available from public database were: (a) short-read MAGs for 19 bacterial species, (

We compared each genome assembly in this study (CanMAG) to the best genome assembly of the same species from public datasets (Table S2). These genome assemblies from public datasets were: (i) short-read MAGs (

Long-read CanMAG assemblies improved all the short-read MAGs for the same species (Table S2). Short-read MAG assemblies were highly fragmented (24 to 223 contigs, mean=144) and had from 0 to 2 ribosomal genes and from 6 to 19 canonical tRNAs (mean=15). In contrast, CanMAGs presented from 9 to 28 ribosomal genes (including 16S, 23S and 5S rRNA genes constituting complete ribosomal operons; different total counts depend on the bacterial species), were more contiguous (1 to 47 contigs, mean=14) and presented at least 18 canonical tRNAs (

Predicted bacteriophages in CanMAGs: main characteristics and clustering information

Most of the predicted bacteriophages (BPs) were integrated into the CanMAG bacterial genome and dsDNA. We clustered them together with the GPD subset to create VCs. BP sequences were classified as: clustered (C), when confidently grouping in a VC; outlier (Out), when despite some links to a VC, the association was not statistically significant; overlap (Ovl), when the BP was linked to two or more VCs; or singleton (S), when it did not match any VC. % Compl., % completeness as assessed by CheckV. Details on the VCs can be found in Table S5.

*Predicted bacterial host for GPD representatives within a specific VC; if variable taxa, we state the lowest shared taxonomic information.

CanMAGs harboured from 0 to 3 prophages with genome sizes ranging from 2515 to 191 453 bp (

To assess the similarity of CanMAG prophages to previous datasets, we clustered our prophages together with a subset of the GPD [

Analysis of the 27 VCs that included CanMAG bacteriophages. Both parts of the figure contain data from the 33 clustered CanMAG bacteriophages and the representatives from GPD grouping together within the same VC. (

All CanMAG prophages were embedded within a highly complete bacterial genome (HQ MAGs and MQ MAGs), so their bacterial host was clear. However, >75 % of the GPD bacteriophages constituting the VCs lacked bacterial host information. This is due to the challenge of recovering genomic context with short-read sequencing data. More specifically, we provided novel bacterial host information for 8 out of the 27 VCs that included GPD viral genomes (

For the other VCs, CanMAG bacteriophages presented similar bacterial hosts as the GPD representatives that had this information within each cluster. Three VCs shared a specific bacterial host at the species level: VC_253 contained bacteriophages only observed in

Finally, all the bacteriophages were predicted to be integrated except for BP3-CanMAG_15, which was circular and lytic. Despite harbouring only one viral protein, it clustered together with other GPD bacteriophages in VC_554, which was probably grouping another extra-chromosomal element rather than a lytic virus. In addition, most of the predicted prophages were dsDNA, except three that VirSorter2 predicted as ssDNA: BP1-CanMAG_17 (

We assessed the functional potential of the CanMAGs by annotating them with the COG (Clusters of Orthologous Genes) database [

Heatmap hierarchical clustering of the most abundant COG functions for CanMAGs. The CanMAGs are divided in two main clusters driven by carbohydrate transport and metabolism relative abundances. Only the most abundant COG functions are represented in the plot, for detailed COG functions see Tables S6 and S7.

Within the first cluster,

Apart from the clear pattern driven by carbohydrate transport and metabolism functions, we also detected that

Finally, another interesting function that presented divergent patterns among CanMAGs was the mobilome, a COG function that is usually missed with short-reads metagenomes [

Long-read metagenomics retrieved long contigs harbouring complete assembled ribosomal operons, prophages and other MGEs. Hi-C allowed the binning of the long contigs into HQ MAGs and MQ MAGs, some of them representing closely related species. Moreover, Hi-C data also linked plasmids to their bacterial host. By combining nanopore long-read metagenomics and Hi-C proximity ligation, we provided 27 HQ MAGs and 7 MQ MAGs from a single sample of the canine gut environment.

To date, only one comprehensive study has used shotgun metagenomics (short-read sequencing) to retrieve MAGs of the canine gut microbiome rather than the 16S rRNA gene to obtain a taxonomic profile [

The CanMAGs improved the short-read-based genome assemblies on public datasets for the species they represented, which mainly derived from shotgun metagenomics and WGS studies. These HQ CanMAGs serve as a proof-of-concept that, extended to more microbiome members and to larger cohorts, will provide biological insights to better understand the canine gut environment in health and disease, such as the impact of microbiome modulation strategies (dietary interventions, or prebiotic and probiotic supplementation).

Animal gut microbiomes have specific taxonomic profiles and specific gene functions associated with the animal's diet, taxonomy and gut morphology, among other factors [

Most of the CanMAGs belonged to

Long-read HQ MAGs are more comparable to complete genomes since they harbour key biological elements such as ARGs, MGEs and prophages that help in the understanding of biological processes like horizontal gene transfer events. The CanMAGs harboured 16 ARGs related to resistance to five different types of antibiotics: tetracycline (8 ARGs in 19 CanMAGs); lincosamides (3 ARGs in 11 CanMAGs); macrolides (2 ARGs in 7 CanMAGs); cephamycin (2 ARGs in 2 CanMAGs); and aminoglycosides (1 ARG in 1 CanMAG). In agreement with our results, ARGs conferring resistance to tetracycline were the most prevalent, followed by lincosamides and macrolides, in the gut of healthy dogs [

Long-read metagenomics identifies transposases and MGEs that are missed with short-read metagenomics studies [

The most common approach to determine a bacteriophage’s bacterial host is by bioinformatically screening CRISPR spacers of bacterial genomes and then further confirming the prediction by analysing co-occurrence patterns between bacterial host and prophages. In the GPD (∼142 000 non-redundant viral genomes), only 28 % of the bacteriophages can be linked to a bacterial host [

Overall, identifying the bacterial host and the co-infections with multiple bacteriophages is critical to understanding the biological impact on the bacterial host metabolism and function, and the global effect on microbiome dynamics, and for the development of phage therapies [

Apart from the experimental binning of the long contigs to retrieve MAGs, Hi-C proximity ligation cross-links extra-chromosomal elements within a single cell [

The technical approach used included a high-molecular-weight DNA extraction, which provided long reads that facilitated the assembly of closely related bacterial species. In fact, we retrieved different bacterial species within the same genera, as seen for

In conclusion, the HQ MAGs improve the short-read-based genome assemblies in public datasets, which mainly derive from shotgun metagenomics and WGS studies. These HQ MAGs present a high added value to better understand the microbiome composition and functional capacity in health and disease and better assess the impact of microbiome modulation strategies with niche-specific databases for non-model organisms. Nanopore sequencing is affordable for any lab, and recent advances in sequencing chemistry and basecalling software have improved the raw read quality, allowing nearly perfect bacterial genomes from metagenomes [
