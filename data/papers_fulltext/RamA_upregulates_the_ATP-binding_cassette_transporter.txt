The global transcriptional activator RamA, classified within the AraC/XylS family of regulatory proteins, plays a vital role in the resistance and pathogenic mechanisms of

Maintenance of lipid asymmetry (Mla) pathway belongs to the ABC transporters which comprise an extensive family of membrane transport proteins that perform a range of functions essential for cell survival in harsh environments and provide intrinsic resistance to multiple antibiotics (

Recent studies have highlighted the key role of the Mla pathway in conferring polymyxin resistance to

On the basis of these findings, we investigated the role of RamA in regulating the expression of

KP22 is a tigecycline-resistant clinical isolate that, compared with

RamA regulates expression of the mla

Given that AraC family transcription factors bind to marbox sequences, we analyzed promoter sequences from approximately 59 bp upstream of the

Our team has previously reported that RamA regulates both the AcrAB and OqxAB efflux pumps, thereby mediating tigecycline resistance in

Antimicrobial susceptibility proﬁle of

Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using the broth microdilution methods and are expressed as μg/mL.

We subsequently sought to determine whether the deletion of

Colony-forming units (CFU) on agar media containing 0.5% SDS and 0.55 mM EDTA were counted, and the CFU per milliliter (CFU/mL) were calculated. The

In this study, we sought to determine at the molecular level how the AraC-type global regulator RamA directly regulate

The AraC family of transcription factors are widely present among bacteria in the

Mla pathway in gram-negative bacteria plays an important role in phospholipid transport (

In conclusion, our findings in this study emphasize that RamA plays a key role in regulating the integral inner membrane ABC permease

Total RNA was extracted from bacterial cells as previously described (
