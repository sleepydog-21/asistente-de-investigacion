Infections caused by carbapenemase-producing

In

According to previous epidemiological studies, OXA-48-like carbapenemases are the most commonly found in

A carbapenem-resistant

Conjugation and transformation experiments were carried out to investigate plasmid transfer. Briefly,

The

Genomic DNA was extracted from overnight cultures of single bacterial colonies using a genome extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Vazyme, China). DNA was sequenced using Illumina short-read sequencing (150 bp paired-end reads) (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States).

AmpC-type β-lactamases are classified as class C enzymes, with different expression patterns depending on their genetic context. These include the inducible expression of chromosomal AmpC β-lactamase, stable de-expression with inducible expression, and plasmid-mediated AmpC β-lactamase. Among these, the

In this study, we identified a novel AmpC β-lactamase gene,

Based on previous epidemiological studies, KPC-type carbapenemases are more common in CRE, while their identification in
