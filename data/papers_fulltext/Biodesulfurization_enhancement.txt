The environmentally friendly process of biodesulfurization (BDS) is brought to the fore as the need for ultra-low sulfur content in diesel and other transportation fuels intensifies. Recalcitrant organosulfur compounds present in crude and diesel oil such as dibenzothiophene (DBT) and its derivatives, can be selectively cleaved for the removal of sulfur without degrading the carbon ring and therefore without sacrificing the heating efficiency of the fuel [

Genomic and enzymatic background of the 4S desulfurization pathway in

The BDS process is greatly affected by a number of factors, including but not limited to the intrinsic properties of the

In addition, several genetic engineering strategies have been employed to address the challenge related to the availability of reducing power during BDS, through the development of recombinant strains harboring synthetic desulfurization cassettes, that comprise rhodococcal

Another important issue is the low viability of the Gram-negative recombinant strains in petroleum or biphasic systems, which necessitates the deployment of more robust bacteria, such as

Despite the advantages of plasmid-based modifications, another critical issue that should be considered when novel microbial biocatalysts are designed is the degree of genetic stability of the recombinants. In this context, genome-based modifications are considered more appropriate for the construction of genetically improved strains, so as to eliminate the risk of plasmid loss and to abolish the need for antibiotic addition during industrial-scale applications [

Recently, several efforts started to pave the way for developing a more viable desulfurization process, as well as elucidating the understudied regulatory mechanisms governing biodesulfurization [

For resting cell biodesulfurization assays, cells were grown in Medium C in the presence of different carbon and sulfur source types and concentrations (described in the respective figure legends). Inoculum was prepared by harvesting cells from LBP agar plates in a S-free Ringer's solution (pH 7.0) and washing twice with the same buffer. For each condition, an initial biomass concentration of 0.05 ± 0.005 g/L was applied. The calculation of biomass concentration, expressed as Dry Cell Weight (DCW), was performed by measuring the optical density at 600 nm (OD

Briefly, cells from two to four identical well cultures were collected by centrifugation, washed with a S-free Ringer's buffer (pH 7.0), and resuspended in 450 μL of 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 8.0). Suspensions were split into three aliquots of 150 μL each, and an equal volume of the same buffer containing 2 mM DBT (prepared from a 100 mM EtOH stock) was subsequently added. The biodesulfurization assay was performed using resting cells for 30 min at 30 °C in a thermostated shaker (1200 rpm) (Thermo Shaker TS-100; BOECO, Germany) and terminated with the addition of an equal volume of acetonitrile (300 μL) and vigorous vortexing. The suspensions were centrifuged (14,000 ×

For cultures supplemented with DBT as the sole source of sulfur, cells were grown in glass culture tubes with 5 mL working volume, at 30 °C and under shaking (180 rpm), while three cultures were inoculated for each strain. Samples of 150 μL were harvested from the growing DBT cultures in Eppendorf tubes at regular intervals, and an equal volume of acetonitrile (150 μL) was added. Cell suspensions were vortexed, centrifuged (14,000 ×

In the present work, for the construction of recombinant biocatalysts, we performed precise (to a single base pair of DNA), unmarked (without leaving any antibiotic resistance cassette), scarless (no “scar” sequence is retained), targeted (eliminating risks of off-target recombination) genetic modifications through a two-step homologous recombination process [
