Since bacterial resistance mechanisms were first described, considerable efforts have been devoted to revealing the underlying molecular machinery involved in developing antimicrobial resistance. Understanding the cellular pathways involved is essential for addressing the growing threat looming over modern medicine–an era where previously effective antibiotics are increasingly unable to treat resistant infections (

Bacterial cultures were grown in lysogeny broth (LB) containing 10 g/L NaCl, either in liquid or solid form. All strains were initially cultured to an OD600 of 0.1 and incubated at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm overnight. For longer weekend incubations, the starting OD600 was reduced to 0.01, and the incubation temperature was adjusted to 30°C. Amoxicillin was supplied by Merck KGaA. A stock solution (10 mM) was prepared which was stored at 4°C and used within three days of preparation and filter sterilization.

Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured twice a week in duplicate for each strain using the broth microdilution method [

Evolution experiments were conducted as described previously [

Genomic DNA was isolated from each culture at both the start and end of the evolution experiment using the PureLink Genomic DNA Mini Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), with some modifications to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cultures were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 1 minute, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 300 μL of TE buffer. Then 40 μL of 10% SDS, 3 μL of 0.5 M EDTA, and 20 μL of proteinase K were added. Cell lysis was achieved by incubating the samples at 65°C for 5 minutes in a heating block. Following lysis, 20 μL of RNase A was added, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 3 minutes. After RNase addition, the protocol was followed as recommended by the supplier.

The quality and quantity of the isolated genomic DNA were assessed using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to measure absorbance at 260/280 nm. The integrity of the DNA was further confirmed by running the samples on a 1% agarose gel. The purified genomic DNA was then used for library preparation according to the manufacturer’s protocol for the NEBNext Ultra II FS DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England BioLabs). The libraries were subsequently sequenced using the Illumina sequencing platform.

Frozen cultures were thawed on ice, followed by overnight inoculation in LB with the appropriate antibiotic concentration (

The entire transcriptomics workflow was designed as a Nextflow pipeline v21.10.6 [

Like the transcriptomic workflow, the genome analysis was also performed using Nextflow. Pair-end genomic reads were quality controlled, and adapters were removed the same way as for the RNA-Seq data. To identify mutations, as well as their frequency in the bacterial population, Breseq v0.37.1 [

The data analysis was performed using Python v 3.11.8 or R v4.3.2 in combination with Jupyter Lab v 4.0.11 (

Comparative analysis of the adaptation to amoxicillin across multiple transfers in three bacterial strains: MG1655 (black/grey), ΔkatE (purple), and ΔdinB (green) with three biological replicates for each strain. On the left: The y-axis represents the antibiotic concentration in micrograms per milliliter on a logarithmic scale, while the x-axis represents the number of transfers. The Venn diagram illustrates the overlapping mutations found in the three bacterial strains. Only mutations with >60% frequency and occurrence in at least 2 replicates are displayed. All strains shared a mutation in frdD. MG1655 and ΔdinB had a mutation between ampC/frdD in common. More detailed information can be found in

Whole genome sequencing of the adapted cultures revealed that the strains only gained a small set of partially overlapping and even identical mutations (see

The table provides detailed information on the mutations identified in the three strains. It includes the frequency of each mutation, the type of mutation, the specific position within the gene, the effect of the mutation, at what position in the genome the change occurred as well on what strand the gene is located. The genome position is relative to each samples corresponding reference genome. NC_000913.3 for MG1655 and NZ_CP009273.1 for ΔdinB and ΔkatE. We observed that some mutations occurred at the same positions across different strains, highlighting the potential importance of these specific genetic changes in the adaptive response to amoxicillin.

All three strains acquired a mutation in

Gene copy analysis revealed that all three strains amplified the same collection of genes after adaptation to amoxicillin (

Reviewer #1: Dear Author,

Thank you for your effort to share your research findings with the scientific community through this manuscript entitled, “Genetic Adaptation to Amoxicillin in Escherichia coli: The Limited Role of dinB and katE” and submitting it for publication in PLOS ONE. I have gone through the manuscript draft and found it quite interesting. The manuscript data is technically sound and supports the conclusions drawn. The description of the experiments conducted indicated that it was rigorously carried out, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. There is adequate evidence that shows data underlying the findings in manuscript are made fully available and presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English. The paper is clear and well-composed. The dataset therein is very useful. There is sufficient justification to affirm the originality of the work, numerical figures of the various analytical factors have been reported with a reasonable degree of accuracy. The objectives of the work as outlined in the introductory part of the manuscript have been reasonably achieved. Thus, the work could be adjudged complete within its limitations. In a nutshell, this is a high-quality manuscript that clarified the contributions of DNA polymerase IV (dinB) and catalase HP2 (katE) genes in E. coli's adaptation to beta-lactam resistance. In particular, the work has established that dinB and katE may not be as critical for beta-lactam adaptation as generally assumed. This could be quite thought-provoking to the scientific community However; I have outlined some comments that could help improve the quality of the manuscript.

Comments:

1. Line 155. There may be no need of a hyphen between 5 and minute, also the word ‘minutes’ should be written in the plural form, to make it consistent with the other usage elsewhere in the manuscript.

2. L192. The concentration of the antibiotic used needs to be specified.

Teichmann et al.,: Genetic Adaptation to Amoxicillin in Escherichia coli: The Limited Role of dinB and katE

Reviewers comments:

Thank you for providing me the opportunity to review this manuscript titled, “Genetic Adaptation to Amoxicillin in Escherichia coli: The Limited Role of dinB and katE” for publication in your journal (PLOS ONE).

2. L192. The concentration of the antibiotic used needs to be specified.

3. L196. Specify the concentration of the agarose used

Accepted and corrected accordingly

4. L439 - 440 The direct involvement of frdD should be further elaborated to adequately discuss its role based on the findings of this study.

Frankly, we found this comments slightly confusing. The Involvement of frdD is extensively discussed in line 414-46. The combined authors came up with the following ideas to address this comment:

1. "Mutations in the frd operon have been described to boost ampC amplification and contribute to beta-lactam resistance”: Here, I guess we could compare the expression of ampC in strains with and without these mutations to add to the data in the cited papers

These data turned out very hard to compare, confusing instead of clarifying the issue.

2. "changes in energy availability and cellular redox status, influenced by frdD expression, may affect the efficiency of cell wall synthesis, and by extension, bacterial susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics.”: This is a long-shot, but could we look at expression of e.g. cell wall synthesis pathway genes in relation to the frdD expression? If we see an association, I guess that would strengthen this case, but this might be hard as I know energy metabolism is affected by a bunch of different things.

This association didn’t materialize either.

3. We already analysed the fumarate reductase/succinate dehydrogenase relationship in detail, so this cannot be expanded.

4. "Superoxide dismutase activity has been linked to antibiotic resistance by activating the stringent response, upregulating efflux pumps, downregulating of the outer membrane porin OmpF, and co-regulation of the multidrug-resistant locus mar”: Do we see these upregulations together with increased frdD levels in our data?

Turns out that this is not the case either.

5. "elevated superoxide levels can increase mutagenesis”: We have the transcriptomics data from the final strains. It might be interesting to compare the frdD levels at the mid-point to the number of mutations in the corresponding final evolved strains. However, this may be comparing apples to oranges.

Indeed, when this analysis was tried, the outcome was an uninterpretable mess.

In short, since the involvement of frdD has already been discussed extensively in the framework oh the literature (lines 414-46), we have decided not to add to that. We hope to have convinced you that this is not out of disrespect for the reviewer or lack of will to make the effort.
