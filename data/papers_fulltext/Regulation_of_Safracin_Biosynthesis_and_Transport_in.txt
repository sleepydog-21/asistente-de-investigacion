Nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) belong to a class of microbial secondary metabolites that have been a prolific source of bioactive compounds with a wide spectrum of medicinal applications, including antibiotics, immunosuppressants, and antineoplastics. This structurally diverse group is assembled from amino acid building blocks by a common thiotemplate-directed multistep reaction mechanism catalyzed by large modular enzymes termed nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) [

Many specialized metabolites perform their ecological roles extracellularly and therefore require transport across cellular membranes. Transporter genes often colocalize in BGCs and have been shown to be compound-specific and necessary for export of the product in many cases [

Taken together, all these data support our hypothesis that MexT and MexS act as an activator and a repressor, respectively, on the expression of BGC sac-tailoring enzymes.

MexT was described as an activator of the MexEF-OprN transport system in

As expected, the safracin production obtained with the complemented mutant strain PMA22ΔmexEF-oprN::Ptac-mexEF-oprN was similar to that obtained with PMA22 (

To reinforce the implication of the MexEF_OprN efflux pump in the metabolism of safracin, we hypothesized that its over-expression could increase safracin production. Therefore, we added an extra copy of the mexEF-oprN operon to the genome of PMA22, generating a new recombinant strain named PMA22::Ptac-mexEF-oprN. The over-expression of the MexEF-OprN transport system in the PMA22::Ptac-mexEF-oprN strain resulted in fourfold higher production of safracin compared to the PMA22 strain (

Safracins were produced in 50 mL flasks with 20 mL culture medium (MS or M63P) inoculated with the

To analyze safracins inside the cell, 100 mL of culture in M63P medium was inoculated in a 500 mL flask from a preinoculum grown for 16 h in LB medium. After three days, the cells were centrifuged in a Sorval Lynx 6000 (Thermo Scientific) centrifuge (rotor F14-6 × 250y) at 4000 rpm for 20–30 min at 4 °C. The cells were resuspended in distilled water and lysed under high pressure (1000 psi) in a French Pressure Cell Press (American Instruments Company). After centrifuging in a Multispeed Centrifuge CL31R (Thermo Scientific) at 3800 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, the obtained liquid fraction was subjected to the extraction process described above for further analysis.

Safracin production was analyzed by HPLC-DAD using Agilent Series 1260 Infinity II, Agilent, Santa Clara CA, USA, equipment and monitored at 268 nm. The reversed-phase separation of the metabolites was performed on a C18 column (ZORBAX Eclipse plus C18, 5 µm, 4.6 × 250 mm, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at room temperature and a volume of injection of 20 μL.
