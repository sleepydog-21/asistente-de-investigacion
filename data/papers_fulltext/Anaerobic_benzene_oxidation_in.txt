Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) are among the most frequently produced chemicals that represent widespread groundwater contaminants worldwide. BTEX compounds are well-known risks to public health; contamination has contributed to pregnancy complications, exposure has been linked to decreased immunity, and studies have determined them as carcinogens (

Anaerobic oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons presents a unique challenge, especially unsubstituted aromatics such as benzene, due to the high dissociation energy necessary for C-C bond cleavage (

Anaerobic aromatic degradation pathways are regulated by proteins belonging to diverse families (

The primers used in this study are listed in Table S1 and were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) (San Jose, CA). All primers were designed specifically for this study based on the full genome sequence of

All cDNA syntheses were performed with gene-specific reverse primers, 0.5 µg total RNA, dNTP mix, RiboLock RNase inhibitor, and RevertAid RT reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) incubated at 42°C for 60 minutes followed by enzyme inactivation at 70°C for 10 minutes. cDNA products were verified by PCR amplification via corresponding primer sets and visualized via gel electrophoresis.

Dilution series of purified RT-PCR amplicons obtained with gene-specific primers were used as calibration standards as described previously (

Benzene and toluene were measured by Beckman Gold High-Pressure Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) (Beckman Coulter, Pasadena, CA) equipped with a Supelco LC-PAH column (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 25 cm x 4.6 mm filled with 5-µm silica particles. The eluent was acetonitrile in water (60:40 [vol:vol]) (flow rate 0.5 mL/min). Acetate, benzoate, nitrate, and succinate were measured by a Dionex ICS-2000 Ion Chromatograph (IC) (Thermo Scientific, Canton, GA) equipped with a Dionex IonPac AS11-HC anionic resin column (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). The eluent was 1 M KOH (flow rate 1.5 mL/min).
