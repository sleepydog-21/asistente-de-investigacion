A crucial component of the metabolic connection between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle is the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) multienzyme complex [

Aside from the

The O

In summary, we demonstrated that PdhR directly negatively regulates the expression of

In

In this study, the transcriptome profiles of the WT and Δ

We realized that PdhR may have an influence on

Previously, there was no pertinent research that mentioned PdhR’s impact on bacterial pathogenicity. However, we discovered that the Δ

Based on previous research and the PdhR binding sites (

Currently, RegulonDB (

In the current investigation, we revealed the PdhR-controlled pathways and our proposal regarding the major regulatory pathways regulated by PdhR in

The human pathogen

Contrary to the findings of our study, previous research reported that PdhR represses flagellar synthesis and motility by regulating the

Gram-negative bacteria are known to use a wide range of virulence factors to subvert eukaryotic cell physiological systems, with the type three-secretion system (T3SS) being one of the most important. The T3SS is a needle-like device that the bacterium employs to inject a varied collection of effector proteins straight into the cytoplasm of host cells, where they can disrupt the host cellular machinery for a variety of reasons [

The prokaryotic proton-translocating NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (NDH-1) is an L-shaped membrane-bound enzyme that contains 14 subunits (NuoA-NuoN or Nqo1-Nqo14) [

The Arc two-component signal transduction system, comprising the kinase sensor ArcB and its cognate response regulator ArcA, is one of the mechanisms that enable bacteria to adapt to changing oxygen availability [

In summary, we revealed the PdhR-controlled pathways in the present study that support the key regulatory role of PdhR in

In this study, the corresponding gene deletion mutants were constructed with the suicide plasmid pRE112 (sucrose-sensitive lethal) method, which uses the principle of homologous recombination [

To explore the regulatory relationship between regulators and downstream genes, qRT-PCR was performed in the WT and gene deletion mutant strains. The overnight bacterial solution was transferred the following day at a 1:100 ratio to fresh medium at 37 °C with shaking until the bacteria had reached an OD600 of 0.6. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C, 9000×

To identify pathways controlled by PdhR, RNA-Seq of the WT and the

The motility assays were performed as described previously [

The proteins for EMSAs in this study, ArcA and FNR, were cloned into pET-28a, expressed in

The ChIP assay was performed as previously described with some modifications [

The luminescence screening assay was performed as previously described [

The dynamic growth experiment for the WT, Δ

The invasion assay was carried out as previously described, with some modifications [

Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism v7.0 software (GraphPad Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) [
