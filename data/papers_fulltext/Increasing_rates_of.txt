Macrolides, such as erythromycin, bind to the 50S subunit of the ribosome and inhibit protein synthesis. Mutations in

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the mechanisms of resistance to erythromycin in France during the 6-year period from 2018 to 2023

A total of 280 clinical isolates of either

Proportion of resistant isolates (%) on the basis of AST and the presence of antimicrobial resistance-associated genes or mutations

Phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) highlighted in gray (AMP: ampicillin; CIP: ciprofloxacin; TET: tetracycline; GEN: gentamicin) was performed via the disk diffusion method and verified

Bacterial species were identified from pure cultures

Erythromycin MICs were determined on MH-F for each isolate included in the present study

To determine erythromycin-associated mechanisms, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on previous pure cultures of each isolate. DNA was extracted

Species were confirmed

Globally, 90% ±5.3% of the raw read data of studied isolates were mapped against their reference genome, and

STRUCTURE analysis of the hypothetical source of contamination revealed a large number of strains that were assigned to the chicken reservoir, which represented 66.8% of the total data set (187 isolates, 166

Each strain had additional resistance markers in addition to erythromycin. Among these erythromycin-resistant isolates, 56.8% of the total data set was also resistant to ampicillin (159 isolates, 144
