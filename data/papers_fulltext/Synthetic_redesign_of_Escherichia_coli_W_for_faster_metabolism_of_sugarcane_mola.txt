Sugarcane molasses is a byproduct of the sucrose production from sugarcane, and its utilization has many advantages, including its abundance, low cost, and high sugar content [

Only a few non-pathogenic

Sugarcane molasses contains not only sucrose, but glucose and fructose as carbon sources, posing challenges for simultaneous metabolism of multiple sugars. Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) is a regulatory mechanism where the presence of a preferred carbon source, often glucose, represses the utilization of alternative carbon sources, including fructose [

To construct pCDF-csc_mono,

To construct pUC-KGG, GPD1 was first cloned to pUC/K. The DNA fragments were ligated after cut with NheI and NdeI, after GPD1 was amplified with GPD1_NdeI-F/GPD1_NheI-R, and pUC/K was amplified with pUC/K_NheI-F/pUC/K_NdeI-R. Then, GPP2 was cloned into the vector after amplified with GPP2_EcoNI-F/GPP2_NheI-R and cut by EcoNI and NheI.

The cells were cultured in a 250-mL baffled flask containing 25 mL of medium, and incubated at 37 ºC with shaking (250 rpm). The modified minimal medium contained 0.5 g/L MgSO

Concentrations of sucrose, glucose, fructose, 3-HP, glycerol, and acetate were measured at 40 °C using high-performance liquid chromatography (Agilent 1260 Infinity II LC System) equipped with Agilent Hi-Plex H column (8 μm, 6.5 mm × 300 mm, PL1F70-6830) at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min using 5 mM H

Fed-batch fermentation was done in a 5-L bioreactor (BioCNS) containing initial 1.5 L of medium at 37 °C, 250 rpm. pH was controlled with 1 M of NaOH to set at 6.7-7.0. And 30 g/L of sugarcane molasses and 4 µM of coenzyme B

We first engineered the uptake system of the primary component of sugarcane molasses, sucrose, to improve its consumption rate. The main non-PTS sucrose metabolism regulon in W is Csc regulon harboring four genes:

5’ UTR sequences for expression of Fru regulon

With the alleviation of CCR, there were more carbon sources available for metabolism, leading to the accumulation of acetate (Supplementary Fig.

To validate the industrial applicability of strains exhibiting increased sucrose consumption rate while simultaneously being able to consume multiple carbon sources, 3-HP was produced using raw material, sugarcane molasses. Multiple heterologous genes were introduced for the construction of the 3-HP pathway in the engineered strain. Harnessing the glycerol pathway as the fundamental route for 3-HP biosynthesis from sugarcane molasses, renowned for its efficiency and productivity, the selection of this pathway was based on the identification of the required enzymes facilitating the conversion from sucrose to glycerol [



3-HP production by optimizing the expression level of

Previous studies reported that downregulating or replacing native GAPDH to enhance NAD(P)H availability and mitigate futile cycles between endogenous and heterologous enzymes [

Fed-batch cultivation of G100_3HP strain with a substrate of sugarcane molasses demonstrated the 3-HP titer of 13.487 g/L and the productivity of 0.180 g/L-h (Fig.



Comparison of titer, yield, and productivity of each 3-HP producing strain

Despite reducing the expression level of

To achieve higher 3-HP titers, genetic engineering efforts had been undertaken, including pathway optimization. This involved the design and implementation of synthetic pathways, to enhance the expression of key pathway genes. Specifically, synthetic promoters and 5’ UTRs had been utilized to drive overexpression of these genes, thereby increasing the flux through the 3-HP biosynthetic pathway. Additionally, flux control mechanisms had been incorporated to redirect metabolic flux more effectively towards 3-HP production. By strategically engineering these pathways and optimizing the associated regulatory element (
