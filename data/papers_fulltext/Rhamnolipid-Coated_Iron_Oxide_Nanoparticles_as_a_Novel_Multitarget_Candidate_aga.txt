Antimicrobial resistance is limiting treatment choices for

Microbial biofilms are surface-attached microbial colonies on a cell that contribute to bacterial persistence on different surfaces, protect the microbes from adverse environmental conditions, and result in infection, accordingly slowing wound healing and making it more difficult to treat infections (

Biofilm formation can be inhibited by self-cleaning and drug-tethered surfaces (

Gallic acid (GA) (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid) is a well-known vigorous natural antioxidant compound found abundantly in various herbs (

Rhamnolipids (RHLs) are low-molecular-weight amphiphilic anionic glycolipid biosurfactants with one or two rhamnose moieties in the hydrophilic head and one or two fatty acid chains in the hydrophobic tail in monorhamnolipids (Rha-C

RHLs are of special importance as green biological agents produced from bacteria, and they have biocompatibility and nontoxicity properties (

In the era of nanotechnology, metals and metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) (mainly Fe

Several studies have proven that the attachment of antioxidants to nanoparticle surfaces increases antioxidant activity and bioavailability for long periods (

Gallic acid is a phenolic acid present in numerous foods and is also an antimicrobial agent, affecting bacterial cell membranes and causing irreversible changes in permeability, rupture, and pore formation (

Considering biofilm formation, the pathogenicity of

The major constituents of staphylococcal biofilms are polysaccharides such as poly-

FTIR spectra measurements were determined using a PerkinElmer 2000 spectrophotometer. Each sample was mixed with crystalline KBr in a 1:10 (sample/KBr) ratio and left for 6 min on the disk for dehydration. A spectrum was measured using wavenumbers in the 400 to 4,000 cm

The means of PS and ZP for the formulations were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using (Malvern Instruments, UK). Each sample was diluted in 3 mL of DI H

qRT-PCR was carried out with bacterial isolates grown in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of either NPs or antibiotic control as described in an earlier section (crystal violet assay) with untreated negative control as reference, using triplicates for each condition. Then, RNA extraction was performed using QIAamp RNeasy minikit (Qiagen GmbH, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Genomic DNA was removed from the samples by treatment with 1 U DNase I, RNase-free (Thermo Scientific) for 60 min at 37°C. Real-time PCR amplification reaction mixtures were prepared in a final volume of 25 μL containing 10 μL of 2× Hera SYBR Green RT-qPCR master mix (Willowfort, UK), 1 μL of RT enzyme mix (20×), 0.5 μL of each primer of 20 pmol concentration, 5 μL of RNase- and DNase-free water, and 3 μL of RNA template.
