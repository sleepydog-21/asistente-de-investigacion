The bacterial flagellum consists of three major components: the basal body, hook, and filament. The basal body contains a rotary motor, which depending on the species uses energy from the proton motive force or a sodium ion gradient to generate torque [

The flagellar motor is anchored within the cell envelope and traverses the outer membrane (OM) in all diderms with the exception of the spirochetes. Depending on the species, the flagellar motor can rotate from hundreds to over 1,000 revolutions per second [

We sought to identify proteins that interact with FapH to gain a better understanding of how FapH protects the barrier function of the OM from flagellum-mediated damage. Moreover, given the close association of the FapH ring and outer disk, we reasoned that identified FapH interaction partners would be good candidates for outer disk components. FapH was reported to interact with HP1409/HP0426 (these proteins are duplicated in

Additional proteins that were pulled-down in the co-IP assays used for the fingerprinting analysis, as well as co-IP samples from two additional replicates were identified by analyzing the total protein content of the samples by mass spectroscopy (

Since FlgP was identified in one of the replicates of the co-IP assay with the FapH-Myc fusion protein, we used a co-IP assay to determine if FapH was pulled-down with FlgP and to also identify other potential FlgP partners. For these co-IP assays, we used cell extracts prepared from a

To examine the validity of the protein interactions predicted from the co-IP assays, we examined the interactions of FapH with selected proteins using the bacterial adenylate cyclase two-hybrid (BACTH) assay [

Given the importance of lipid asymmetry for OM barrier function, bacteria have evolved various systems for removing GPLs that make their way into the outer leaflet of the OM. One mechanism for removing GPLs from the outer leaflet of the OM in

A third mechanism for removing GPLs from the outer leaflet of the OM is the phospholipase PldA, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of acyl ester bonds in GPLs that enter the outer leaflet of the OM to generate lysophospholipids and free fatty acids [

The

An intriguing question is what is the mechanism by which the FapH ring protects the OM from flagellum-dependent damage? One possibility is that the lipid moieties of FapH secure GPLs in the inner leaflet of the OM and prevent them from flipping into the outer leaflet. Additional

An alternative mechanism by which the FapH ring may protect the barrier function of the OM from flagellum-mediated damage is that it acts as a bushing and/or bearing (i.e., analogous function to the L-ring) to balance the flagellum as it rotates. The FapH ring is positioned near the base of the hook and may keep the hook aligned as the flagellum rotates to help to protect the integrity of the OM and flagellar sheath in this region.

Although FlgP, HP1456, and HP1454 were identified as FapH interaction partners in the co-IP assays and BACTH assays (

While the flagellar sheath may potentiate flagellum-mediated damage to the OM in

As our knowledge of the structural diversity of bacterial flagellar motors has grown, it has become clear that more work needs to be done to understand the roles of flagellar motor accessory structures. The characterization of motor accessories will undoubtedly lead to the discovery of novel mechanisms for regulating motor function or mitigating cellular damage resulting from action of the motor as we demonstrated here for the FapH ring of the
