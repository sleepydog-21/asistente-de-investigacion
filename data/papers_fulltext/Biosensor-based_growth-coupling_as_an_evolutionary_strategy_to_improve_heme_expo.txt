The iron-containing porphyrin heme serves as prosthetic group in essential proteins and plays a central role in many important cellular processes, like respiration and electron transfer. Additionally, heme serves as iron resource in iron-depleted environments [

Selection on plates using growth-coupled biosensor strains. Growth and fluorescence of different growth-coupled biosensor strains of

For both constructs, > 25 colonies of different sizes and fluorescent intensities were picked for further analysis. Bigger colonies which did not show a fluorescent signal were classified as cheater strains and therefore not selected.

As depicted by [

Samples of the last three batches were streaked on agar plates to enable isolation of single clones. Three clones from each of these three populations underwent Sanger sequencing tests to exclude cheater mutations in the biosensor region. Notably, from in total nine analyzed clones only one represented a classical cheater strain.



Automated fluorescence ALE of

In total, 19 clones were selected from plate screening and 4 clones from repetitive batch ALE for further analysis. Specific fluorescence of clones was quantified as a read-out for



Screening of selected::

WGS of the selected clones led to the revelation of several mutations, with the key mutations depicted in Table
