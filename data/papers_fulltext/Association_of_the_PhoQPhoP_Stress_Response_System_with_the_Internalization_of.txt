A class II type A/B3 biosafety cabinet (NuAire Inc., Plymouth, MN, USA) was used as a lettuce growth chamber for this study. The lettuce was grown in soil or hydroponic media without recirculation and aeration at room temperature, as detailed in

To grow lettuce in soil, ten plastic pots (9 cm in diameter × 10 cm in height) were filled with approximately 150 g of potting mix (Miracle-Gro Co., Marysville, OH, USA) and placed individually in a 500 mL plastic beaker to avoid any potential cross-contamination among pots via irrigation water. The entire set of pots with beakers was autoclaved at 121 °C for 15 min before seeding. In each pot, five to ten seeds (Paris White Cos, Morgan County Seeds LLC, Barnett, MO, USA) were planted at a depth of about 0.5 in below the soil surface. Sterile deionized water (400 mL) was periodically added into the beakers to moisten the soil, and 1.5 mL of the aforementioned

Once the lettuce germinated, the two sturdiest seedlings were kept in each pot, and the others were removed. Fertilizing was carried out, as aforementioned in

In parallel, 10 beakers (250 mL) were used for the hydroponic growth of lettuce. Rock wool cubes (5 × 5 × 5 cm) (Halatool Co, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China) were autoclaved and used as a seed holder. Five to ten lettuce seeds were placed on a rock wool cube and transferred inside the aforementioned beaker filled with 150 mL of a hydroponic growth broth, Grow Big

The above experiments were conducted three times.

Five lettuce leaves from each pot were harvested by aseptic cutting on days 20 (D20), 30 (D30), and 40 (D40) after the generation of seeds (day 0), respectively. The leaves were dipped in a 10% bleach solution for 5 s [

In summary, strains 86-24, 93-111, C7927, and MF1847 were detectable in lettuce, and shared the unique ORF-4296, as well as an identical PhoP-PhoQ operon. In contrast, strain 505B was undetectable in lettuce, lacked ORF-4296, and exhibited differences in the C-terminal region of PhoQ.
