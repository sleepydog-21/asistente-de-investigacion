We previously reported that RDT occurs at the end of

RNase E-mediated endonucleolytic cleavage and RNase II-mediated exonucleolytic processing are the source of the 3′ ends of pre-

RNase II aids in the degradation of RDT-generated mRNA 3′ end in the

As RNase E cleavage can cause changes in the abundance and integrity of RNA transcripts, understanding where and how RNase E cleaves the transcripts will help decipher the posttranscriptional control mechanisms. For determining the exact location of the 3′ ends of pre-

Data from this study suggest that multiple RNase E cleavages occur between 1700 and 1900, and the 3′ end generated at 1183 by RDT is processed to the 3′ ends of

In the second instance, when translation initiation fails stochastically, in the absence of a bound ribosome, certain regions of mRNA, particularly those near the ribosome-binding site and the start codon, remain unprotected, exposing the RNase E cleavage sites (

In this study, using northern blotting and RACE assays, we demonstrated that RNase E-mediated cleavage contributes to the formation of

The RNA preparation was treated with Turbo DNase I (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) to eliminate any DNA contamination. 3′ RACE and 5′ RACE assays were conducted according to previously described methods to amplify either the 3′ or 5′ RNA ends (
