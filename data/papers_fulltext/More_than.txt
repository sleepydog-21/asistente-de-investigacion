Colistin, a polycationic peptide, serves as a last-resort antimicrobial, which can be used to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR), and pan-drug-resistant (PDR) Gram-negative bacteria (

Overall, this initial BLASTP search yielded a total of 9,836 MCR and MCR-like AA sequences, which were used in subsequent steps (

NCBI RefSeq Assembly accession numbers for all genomes associated with ≥1 MCR or MCR-like protein in NCBI’s IPG database were acquired via rentrez (see section “Acquisition of MCR and MCR-like amino acid sequences” above). Latest assembly versions for all RefSeq genomes were then downloaded via NCBI’s FTP site (

To assign each genome to a species using a standardized taxonomic framework, all 59,121 genomes were assigned to a marker-gene based operational taxonomic unit (mOTU) using classify-genomes (accessed June 3, 2020;

Of the 69,814 MCR and MCR-like proteins identified in 59,121 genomes from NCBI’s RefSeq database (see section “Acquisition and characterization of genomes harboring MCR-like proteins” above), we identified 321 MCR-like proteins, which were located on the same contig as (i) ≥1 plasmid replicon (detected via ABRicate and the PlasmidFinder database) and (ii) ≥1 additional AMR gene (detected via ABRicate and the NDARO), with contigs harboring previously described

Heatmap showcasing colistin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values reported for MCR alleles in their native strains and in heterologous expression systems. MIC values were obtained from a review of the literature (see the Materials and Methods section for details). Heatmap cell colors correspond to base-2 logarithm-transformed MIC values, where white cells denote a value of 1 (i.e., the log2-transformed colistin resistance breakpoint of 2 mg/L, established by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [CLSI]); blue shading denotes MIC values below this breakpoint, and red shading denotes MIC values above. MCR alleles with no data reported for a given species (due to the allele not being present in the species, or due to an MIC not being reported) are denoted in the heatmap by black shading. For individual species with multiple MIC values reported for a single MCR allele, the median MIC value is reported (
