Isoprenoid quinones are widely distributed in the three domains of life and globally act as electron and proton carriers (

Aerobic UQ biosynthesis pathway includes nine steps (

Anaerobic UQ biosynthesis is formed by a subset of the enzymes of the aerobic pathway, namely UbiA, UbiB, UbiC, UbiD, UbiE, UbiG, and UbiX, that function with UbiT, UbiU, and UbiV proteins solely required under anaerobiosis (

In this work, we aimed at identifying the conditions under which UbiUVT proteins are produced and the genetic regulatory mechanisms involved, and the physiological role of UbiUVT. We concluded that (i) thanks to Fnr control, UbiUV ensures the production of UQ under a range of O

Most knockout strains were obtained by generalized Φ P1 transduction using donor strains from the Keio collection (

Strains were grown in LB Miller (10 g/L of tryptone, 10 g/L of NaCl, and 5 g/L of yeast extract) or M9 medium (6 g/L Na

For microaerobic experiments, media and plates were pre-equilibrated and cells were cultured in a Whitley H35 hypoxic station with 95% N

For aerobic cultures, 5 mL of LB medium, supplemented with ampicillin (100 µg/mL) and 0.05% arabinose when necessary to induce the expression from the pBAD vectors, was inoculated with 100 µL of overnight culture in glass tubes (15 cm long and 2 cm in diameter) and incubated at 37°C, 180 rpm overnight.

Anaerobic cultures were performed in Hungate tubes as previously described (

Four-week-old female BALB/cByJ were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Saint-Germain-Nuelles) and were acclimatized in a controlled animal facility under specific pathogen-free conditions for 2 weeks prior to the beginning of the colonization assay. Mice were randomly assigned to groups of three or five per cage, and ear punching was used to identify each mouse in a given cage.

The colonization experiments were adapted and performed as previously described (

The relative abundance of both competing strains was then monitored for several days post-inoculation in fecal samples. Fecal samples were collected from each mouse in pre-weighed 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes containing the equivalent of 100-µL glass beads (diameter 0.25–0.5 mm) and 80-µL PBS, and the feces weight was determined. A volume of PBS was then added to each tubeto obtain a final concentration of 0.15 g of feces per 1-mL PBS. The feces were homogenized by vortexing for 2 minutes, serially diluted by 10-fold steps up to a 10

UQ is an essential component of electron transfer chains and of respiratory metabolism. For decades, the dogma has been that UQ was exclusively used for aerobic respiratory metabolism, whereas DMK/MK was used for electron transfer in anaerobic respiratory chains. Following our recent discovery that UQ is also synthesized under anaerobiosis, which contradicted the above assumption (
