Antibiotic-resistant bacteria
are of great concern, especially when they are resistant to multiple
or last resort antibiotics. The 2016 published O’Neill report
warns that antimicrobial resistance (AMR)-related deaths will exceed
those caused by cancer until 2050, unless this trend is slowed decisively.

In 2017, the high-level DAP-resistant

High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), e.g.,
by means of a qTOF
instrument, has gained great importance for the qualification of unknown
molecules in complex matrices. By providing high mass resolution and
accuracy (<5 ppm), HRMS acquisition schemes such as the information-dependent
acquisition (IDA) offer the possibility of structural elucidation.

In this study, we aimed at elucidating the molecular fate
of DAP

When comparing the
sum formulas of features 1 and 2, it becomes clear that feature 2
formally contains an additional water molecule. Since none of the
fragments in the pattern of feature 2 exhibit a corresponding shift,
this may be explained by a hydrolysis of the lactone moiety of the
core. The fragment pathway of feature 1 (

The DrcAB-mediated reaction
postulated requires the presence of
the KYN anilino function, which appears to act as a nucleophile. In
addition, another reaction partner is necessary to generate the product
that was found. DAP′s mode of action can be regarded as a kind
of oligomerization, and the site of action is located in phosphatidylglycerol
(PG) and bactoprenyl-coupled lipid-intermediate-rich regions in the
bacterial membrane.

Postulated daptomycin (DAP) inactivation was mediated
in two steps
by DrcAB. (a) First, dehydroalanine (DHA) or its tautomer 2-iminopropanoic
acid (2-IPA) is transferred to the anilino function of the kynurenine
(KYN) moiety of DAP. (b) This reaction is followed by a hydrolytic
cleavage of the lactone bond between KYN and threonine (Thr). Trp:
tryptophane, Asn: asparagine, Asp: aspartic acid, Gly: glycine, Orn:
ornithine, Ala: alanine, Ser: serine, mGlu: methyl glutamic acid.

The α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group
of DHA is a potent
Michael-acceptor and, thus, prone to react with nucleophiles (Michael-donors),
such as thiols, amines, or alcohols.

With growing molecular weights, the number of
possible sum formulas and their corresponding constitutional isomers
increases. Hence, with regard to structural elucidation using LC-MS/HRMS
approaches, the probable results are becoming increasingly blurred,
particularly for multiple charged ions. Thus, structures proposed
in this process must undergo (several) confirmation stages.

The most reliable confirmation is a targeted approach, in which the
fragment pattern of an authentic reference substance is used for verification.

The occurrence of the DHA moiety as an artifact, which emerges
from amino acids, such as alanine, cysteine, or serine during the
MS-ionization process, is theoretically possible. However, this scenario
is unlikely to occur since ESI is a soft ionization technique.

Recent structure–activity relationship models
of DAP attribute
KYN a crucial role in the interaction with the lipid bilayer, in the
binding of calcium, and therefore in the antibacterial activity. In
particular, Taylor and Palmer demonstrated a 47-fold loss of activity
after replacing KYN with tyrosine, whereas Chow et al. demonstrated
an increase in activity after KYN

Apart from that,
the question of the origin of DHA or its derivatives
arises. Grein et al. postulated the interruption and delocalization
of the cell wall biosynthesis machinery (transpeptidase and transglycosylase)
as the main mode of action of DAP. They were able to demonstrate the
formation of a tripartite complex of Ca

which was held for 2 min, raised to 60% B within 8 min, held for 0.5
min, and in the following 29.5 min, raised to 90% B. Eventually, a
reconditioning step was carried out by decreasing the gradient to
the initial conditions within 1 min, which was held for 4 min. The

scans were then conducted based on the results of

For the GUCS approach employing a non-targeted workflow, data obtained
from measurements of the test and the reference sample were used.
An automated process, comprising a peak finding algorithm with subsequent
comparison of the test and reference samples, revealed all unique
features that were found in both samples. To avoid including peaks
within the noise level, only those features with a minimum area ratio
of ten (test/reference) were selected for further analysis of their
structural composition.

Based on the targeted HRMS scans, sum
and structural formulas were developed by means of the software integrated
formula finder and in silico fragmentation tool, the exact mass (mass
error <5 ppm), the isotopic distribution ratio, chemical restrictions,
and the known fragments of DAP. When all aforementioned conditions
were not in conflict for a proposed molecular structure, it was considered
probable.
