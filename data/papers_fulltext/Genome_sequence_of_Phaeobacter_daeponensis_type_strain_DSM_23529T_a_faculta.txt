The draft genome sequence was generated using Illumina sequencing technology. For this genome, we constructed and sequenced an Illumina short-insert paired-end library with an average insert size of 221 bp, which generated 21,978,034 reads, and an Illumina long-insert paired-end library with an average insert size of 9,327 +/- 1,586 bp, which generated 19,261,756 reads totaling 6,186 Mbp of Illumina data. All general aspects of library construction and sequencing performed can be found at the JGI web site [

The 276 kb RepC-8 type replicon pDaep_A276 contains an additional DnaA-like I replicase gene (Daep_04147), but the

The 174 kb plasmid pDaep_B174 contains two RepABC-9 type replication modules (

This plasmid contains many transposases and putative phage-derived components including a DNA-primase (Daep_04238) and an RNA-directed DNA polymerase (Daep_04390). The general operon structure of this plasmid seems to be scrambled by transposition or recombination events, as illustrated by the type-IV secretion system. pDaep_B174 contains two copies of the characteristic

Finally, the most conspicuous finding on this plasmid is the presence of a complete or nearly complete phenylacetate catabolon (Daep_04356 to Daep_04367), containing

The 117 kb RepA-I type replicon pDaep_C117 contains a LuxR-type two-component transcriptional regulator (Daep_03918) and a complete rhamnose operon [
