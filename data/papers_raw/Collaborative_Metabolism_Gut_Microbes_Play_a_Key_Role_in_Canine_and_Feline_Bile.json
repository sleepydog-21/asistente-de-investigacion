  "abstract": "Bile acids, produced by the liver and secreted into the gastrointestinal tract, are dynamic molecules capable of impacting the overall health of dogs and cats in many contexts. Importantly, the gut microbiota metabolizes host primary bile acids into chemically distinct secondary bile acids. This review explores the emergence of new literature connecting microbial-derived bile acid metabolism to canine and feline health and disease. Moreover, this review highlights multi-omic methodologies for translational research as an area for continued growth in veterinary medicine aimed at accelerating microbiome science and medicine as it pertains to bile acid metabolism in dogs and cats.",
