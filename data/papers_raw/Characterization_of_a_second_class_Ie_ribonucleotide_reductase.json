  "abstract": "Class I ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) convert ribonucleotides into deoxyribonucleotides under oxic conditions. The R2 subunit provides a radical required for catalysis conducted by the R1 subunit. In most R2s the radical is generated on a tyrosine via oxidation by an adjacent metal site. The discovery of a metal-free R2 defined the new RNR subclass Ie. In R2e, three of the otherwise strictly conserved metal-binding glutamates in the active site are substituted. Two variants have been found, VPK and QSK. To date, the VPK version has been the focus of biochemical characterization. Here we characterize a QSK variant of R2e. We analyse the organismal distribution of the two R2e versions and find dozens of organisms relying solely on the QSK RNR for deoxyribonucleotide production. We demonstrate that the R2e",
