  "abstract": "Cyanobacteria play pivotal roles in global biogeochemical cycles through oxygenic photosynthesis. To maintain cellular homeostasis, these organisms utilize sophisticated acclimation mechanisms to adapt to environmental fluctuations, particularly concerning nitrogen availability. While nitrogen deprivation induces dormancy, excess ammonium can have toxic effects on cyanobacteria and other photosynthetic organisms-a phenomenon for which the acclimation mechanisms remain poorly understood. Through the physiological characterization of knockout and overexpression mutants in",
