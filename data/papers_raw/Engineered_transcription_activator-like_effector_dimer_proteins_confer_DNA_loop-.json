  "abstract": "Natural prokaryotic gene repression systems often exploit DNA looping to increase the local concentration of gene repressor proteins at a regulated promoter via contributions from repressor proteins bound at distant sites. Using principles from the Escherichia coli lac operon we design analogous repression systems based on target sequence-programmable Transcription Activator-Like Effector dimer (TALED) proteins. Such engineered switches may be valuable for synthetic biology and therapeutic applications. Previous TALEDs with inducible non-covalent dimerization showed detectable, but limited, DNA loop-based repression due to the repressor protein dimerization equilibrium. Here, we show robust DNA loop-dependent bacterial promoter repression by covalent TALEDs and verify that DNA looping dramatically enhances promoter repression in E. coli. We characterize repression using a thermodynamic model that quantitates this favorable contribution of DNA looping. This analysis unequivocally and quantitatively demonstrates that optimized TALED proteins can drive loop-dependent promoter repression in E. coli comparable to the natural LacI repressor system. This work elucidates key design principles that set the stage for wide application of TALED-dependent DNA loop-based repression of target genes.",
