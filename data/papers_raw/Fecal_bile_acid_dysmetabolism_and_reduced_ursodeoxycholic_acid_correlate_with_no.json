  "abstract": "Microbial-derived secondary bile acids (SBAs) are reabsorbed and sensed via host receptors modulating cellular inflammation and fibrosis. Feline chronic kidney disease (CKD) occurs with progressive renal inflammation and fibrosis, mirroring the disease pathophysiology of human CKD patients. Prospective cross-sectional study compared healthy cats ( CKD cats had significantly reduced fecal concentrations (median 12.8â€‰ng/mg, Mann-Whitney The gut-kidney axis mediated through microbial-derived SBAs appears relevant to the spontaneous animal CKD model of domestic cats. This includes reduced fecal concentrations of the microbial-derived SBA UDCA, known to regulate inflammation and fibrosis and be reno-protective. Microbes correlated with fecal SBAs include",
