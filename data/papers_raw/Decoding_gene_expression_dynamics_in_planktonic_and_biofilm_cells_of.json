  "abstract": "Dental caries is the most prevalent chronic infectious disease globally, with Transcriptomic analysis was conducted to examine gene expression patterns in Several genes and operons were differentially expressed across the tested growth phases, with 1,095 genes showing differential expression between stationary-phase, planktonic and biofilm cells. Pathway analysis revealed significant changes in ascorbate metabolism, carbohydrate utilization and transport systems, lipoic acid metabolism, bacterial toxin pathways, two-component regulatory systems, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Notably, expression of the This study provides key insights into gene expression dynamics that drive biofilm formation in",
