  "abstract": "Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an opportunistic pathogen, is ubiquitously distributed in the environment. In response to iron-depletion stress, S. maltophilia synthesizes the sole catecholate-type siderophore, stenobactin, for ferric iron acquisition. FepAsm, a TonB-dependent transporter (TBDT), is the sole known outer membrane receptor responsible for ferri-stenobactin uptake in S. maltophilia K279a. However, S. maltophilia KJ and its isogenic fepA mutant displayed comparable ability to utilize FeCl Twelve TBDTs, whose expression were significantly upregulated in 2,2'-dipyridyl-treated KJ strain, were selected as candidates for ferri-stenobactin uptake. The involvement of these selected candidates in ferri-stenobactin acquisition was investigated using deletion mutant construction and FeCl FepAsm, fciABC, sbaA, sbaBCDEF, and feoB contribute to ferri-stenobatin acquisition in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia KJ.",
