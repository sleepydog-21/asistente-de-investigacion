  "abstract": "Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens are an ongoing threat to human and animal health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), colistin is considered the last resort antibiotic against human infections due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative organisms-including The recombinant production of large membrane proteins in their native forms is a bottleneck in modern molecular biology. In this study, we recombinantly produced PmrC and biophysically characterised it in solution. We employed We successfully produced PmrC PetN transferase membrane protein in high yields and showed that PmrC is a stable α-β protein, with melting temperature T Our study provides a molecular characterisation of PmrC and demonstrates the importance of PmrC as a drug target and the strong potential of PmrC binding molecules to act as colistin adjuvants, operating as synergistic tools to combat multiresistant nosocomial pathogens.",
