  "abstract": "Transcription attenuation in response to the availability of a specific amino acid is believed to be controlled by alternative configurations of RNA secondary structures that lead to the arrest of translation or the release of the arrested ribosome from the leader mRNA molecule. In this study, we first report a possible example of the DnaA-dependent riboswitch for transcription attenuation in",
