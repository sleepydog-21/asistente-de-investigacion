  "abstract": "When targeting robust, high-yielding bioprocesses, phenomena such as population heterogeneity have to be considered. Therefore, the influence of the conditions which the cells experience prior to the main culture should also be evaluated. Here, the influence of a pre-culture medium (complex vs. minimal medium), optical density for inoculation of the main culture (0.005, 0.02 and 0.0125) and harvest time points of the pre-culture in exponential growth phase (early, mid and late) on the level of population heterogeneity in batch cultures of the",
