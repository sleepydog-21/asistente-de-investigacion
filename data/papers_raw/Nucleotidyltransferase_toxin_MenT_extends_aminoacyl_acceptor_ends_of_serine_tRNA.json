  "abstract": "Toxins of toxin-antitoxin systems use diverse mechanisms to inhibit bacterial growth. In this study, we characterize the translation inhibitor toxin MenT3 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium responsible for tuberculosis in humans. We show that MenT3 is a robust cytidine specific tRNA nucleotidyltransferase in vitro, capable of modifying the aminoacyl acceptor ends of most tRNA but with a marked preference for tRNA",
