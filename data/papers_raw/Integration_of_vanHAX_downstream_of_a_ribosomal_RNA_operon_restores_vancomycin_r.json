  "abstract": "During the genomic characterisation of Enterococcus faecium strains (n = 39) collected in a haematology ward, we identified an isolate (OI25), which contained vanA-type vancomycin resistance genes but was phenotypically susceptible to vancomycin. OI25 could revert to resistance when cultured in the presence of vancomycin and was thus considered to be vancomycin-variable. Long-read sequencing was used to identify structural variations within the vancomycin resistance region of OI25 and to uncover its resistance reversion mechanism. We found that OI25 has a reduced ability to positively regulate expression of the vanHAX genes in the presence of vancomycin, which was associated with the insertion of an IS6-family element within the promoter region and the first 50 bp of the vanR gene. The vancomycin-resistant revertant isolates constitutively expressed vanHAX genes at levels up to 36,000-fold greater than OI25 via co-transcription with a ribosomal RNA operon. The vancomycin-resistant revertants did not exhibit a significant growth defect. During VRE outbreaks, attention should be paid to contemporaneous vancomycin-susceptible strains as these may carry silent vancomycin resistance genes that can be activated through genomic rearrangements.",
