  "abstract": "More effective treatments are needed for impaired fasting glucose or glucose intolerance, known as prediabetes. Sulforaphane is an isothiocyanate that reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis in individuals with type 2 diabetes and is well tolerated when provided as a broccoli sprout extract (BSE). Here we report a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which drug-naive individuals with prediabetes were treated with BSE (n = 35) or placebo (n = 39) once daily for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was a 0.3 mmol l",
