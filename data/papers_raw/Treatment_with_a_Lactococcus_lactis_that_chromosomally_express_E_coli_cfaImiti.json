  "abstract": "Sjögren's Syndrome (SjS) results in loss of salivary and lacrimal gland excretion due to an autoimmune attack on these secretory glands. Conventional SjS treatments address the symptoms, but not the cause of disease. Recognizing this deficit of treatments to reverse SjS disease, studies were pursued using the fimbriae from enterotoxigenic E. coli, colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I), which has anti-inflammatory properties. To determine if CFA/I fimbriae could attenuate SjS-like disease in C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 (SjS) females, the Lactococcus lactis (LL) 301 strain was developed to chromosomally express the cfaI operon. Western blot analysis confirmed CFA/I protein expression, and this was tested in SjS females at different stages of disease. Repeated dosing with LL 301 proved effective in mitigating salivary flow loss and in reducing anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and inflammation in the submandibular glands (SMGs) in SjS females and in restoring salivary flow in diseased mice. LL 301 treatment reduced proinflammatory cytokine production with concomitant increases in TGF-β",
