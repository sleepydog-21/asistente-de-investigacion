In Japan, combinations of antimicrobial resistance genes in Antimicrobial resistance transfer was tested in The high homology between pSal_249Sch and pSal_238Inf suggests they have a common ancestor. Because the sequences of pSal_238Inf and pSal_249Sch were highly homologous to pESI (a plasmid for emerging These data on the structural diversity of pESI-like plasmids suggest that some time has passed since",
