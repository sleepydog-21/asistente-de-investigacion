  "abstract": "Bifidobacteria are probiotic microorganisms commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract, some of which are known to utilize linear arabino-oligosaccharides (AOS) as prebiotic carbohydrates. In general, the synergistic actions of exo-type α-l-arabinofuranosidases (ABFs) and endo-α-1,5-l-arabinanases (ABNs) are required for efficient arabinan degradation. In this study, the putative gene cluster for arabinan degradation was discovered in the genome of",
