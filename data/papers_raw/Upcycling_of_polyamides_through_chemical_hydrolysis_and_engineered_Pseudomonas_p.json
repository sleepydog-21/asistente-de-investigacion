  "abstract": "Aliphatic polyamides, or nylons, are widely used in the textile and automotive industry due to their high durability and tensile strength, but recycling rates are below 5%. Chemical recycling of polyamides is possible but typically yields mixtures of monomers and oligomers which hinders downstream purification. Here, Pseudomonas putida KT2440 was engineered to metabolize C",
