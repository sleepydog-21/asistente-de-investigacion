  "abstract": "Antibiotics, by definition, reduce bacterial growth rates in optimal culture conditions; however, the real-world environments bacteria inhabit see rapid growth punctuated by periods of low nutrient availability. How antibiotics mediate population decline during these periods is poorly understood. Bacteria cannot optimize for all environmental conditions because a growth-longevity tradeoff predicts faster growth results in faster population decline, and since bacteriostatic antibiotics slow growth, they should also mediate longevity. We quantify how antibiotics, their targets, and resistance mechanisms influence longevity using populations of",
