  "abstract": "Escherichia coli is a useful platform for producing valuable materials through the implementation of synthetic gene(s) derived from other organisms. The production of lactate (LA)-based polyester poly[LA-co-3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB)] was carried out in E. coli using a set of five other species-derived genes: Pseudomonas sp. 61-3-derived phaC1STQK (for polymerization), Cupriavidus necator-derived phaAB (for 3HB-CoA generation), and Megasphaera elsdenii-derived pct (for LA-CoA generation) cloned into pTV118NpctphaC1p",
