  "abstract": "Bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) are self-assembled protein structures often utilized by bacteria as a modular metabolic unit, enabling the catalysis and utilization of less common carbon and nitrogen sources within a self-contained compartment. The The human gut is a complex environment of different bacterial species, nutrient sources, and changing conditions that are essential for human health. An imbalance can allow for the emergence of opportunistic pathogens. Bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) are utilized by bacteria to metabolize less common nutrients, conferring a growth advantage. Although widely studied in enteropathogens, there is limited research on BMC activity in commensal species. We demonstrate the formation of the eut BMC and utilization of ethanolamine as a carbon source in the human gut commensal",
