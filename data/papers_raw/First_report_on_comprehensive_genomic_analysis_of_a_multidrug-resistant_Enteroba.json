  "abstract": "Enterobacter asburiae (E. asburiae) is a gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium which has emerging significance as an opportunistic pathogen having high virulence pattern and drug resistant properties. In this study, we present the detailed analysis of the whole genome sequence of a multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. asburiae strain BDW1M3 from Bangladesh. The isolate was collected from an infected foot wound of a diabetic foot ulcer patient. Through sophisticated genomic techniques encompassing whole genome sequencing and in-depth bioinformatic analyses, this research unveils a profound understanding of the isolate's antimicrobial resistance patterns, virulence determinants, biosynthetic gene clusters, metabolic pathways and pathogenic potential. The isolate displayed resistance to Ampicillin, Fosfomycin, Cefoxitin, Tigecycline, Meropenem, Linezolid, Vancomycin antibiotics and demonstrated the capacity for biofilm formation. Several antimicrobial resistance genes such as bla",
