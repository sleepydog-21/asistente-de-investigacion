  "abstract": "Recent discoveries establish DNA and RNA as bona fide substrates for ADP-ribosylation. NADAR (\"NAD- and ADP-ribose\"-associated) enzymes reverse guanine ADP-ribosylation and serve as antitoxins in the DarT-NADAR operon. Although NADARs are widespread across prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and viruses, their specificity and broader physiological roles remain poorly understood. Using phylogenetic and biochemical analyses, we further explore de-ADP-ribosylation activity and antitoxin functions of NADAR domains. We demonstrate that different subfamilies of NADAR proteins from representative",
