  "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is a global healthcare crisis. Bacteria are highly adaptable and can rapidly acquire mechanisms of resistance towards conventional antibiotics. The permeability barrier conferred by the Gram-negative bacteria cell envelope constitutes a first line of defence against the action of antibiotics. Exposure to extracytoplasmic stresses can negatively affect cell envelope homoeostasis and this causes localised protein misfolding, compromised envelope integrity and impairs barrier function. The CpxA-CpxR two-component regulatory system has evolved to sense extracytoplasmic stresses and to regulate processes that restore homoeostasis of the cell envelope. Hence, controlled Cpx-signalling assists bacteria in adapting, surviving and proliferating in harsh environments, including exposure to antibiotics. Herein, we determined that an intact Cpx-signalling is key to maintaining the",
