  "abstract": "Heavy metals, including mercury, are non-biodegradable and highly toxic to microorganisms even at low concentrations. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the environmental adaptability of microorganisms with Hg resistance holds promise for their use in Hg bioremediation. We characterized GbsMerA, a mercury reductase belonging to the mercury-resistant operon of Gelidibacter salicanalis PAMC21136, and found its maximum activity of 474.7 µmol/min/mg in reducing Hg",
