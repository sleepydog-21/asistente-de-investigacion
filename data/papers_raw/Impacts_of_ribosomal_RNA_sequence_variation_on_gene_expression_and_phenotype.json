  "abstract": "Since the framing of the Central Dogma, it has been speculated that physically distinct ribosomes within cells may influence gene expression and cellular physiology. While heterogeneity in ribosome composition has been reported in bacteria, protozoans, fungi, zebrafish, mice and humans, its functional implications remain actively debated. Here, we review recent evidence demonstrating that expression of conserved variant ribosomal DNA (rDNA) alleles in bacteria, mice and humans renders their actively translating ribosome pool intrinsically heterogeneous at the level of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). In this context, we discuss reports that nutrient limitation-induced stress in",
