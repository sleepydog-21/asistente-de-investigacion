  "abstract": "Cellular fitness depends on multiple phenotypes that must be balanced during evolutionary adaptation. For instance, coordinating growth and motility is critical for microbial colonization and cancer invasiveness. In bacteria, these phenotypes are controlled by local regulators that target single operons, as well as by global regulators that impact hundreds of genes. However, how the different levels of regulation interact during evolution is unclear. Here, we measured in",
