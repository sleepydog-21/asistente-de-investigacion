  "abstract": "The unique biological and rheological properties make hyaluronic acid a sought-after material for medicine and cosmetology. Due to very high purity requirements for hyaluronic acid in medical applications, the profitability of streptococcal fermentation is reduced. Production of hyaluronic acid by recombinant systems is considered a promising alternative. Variations in combinations of expressed genes and fermentation conditions alter the yield and molecular weight of produced hyaluronic acid. This review is devoted to the current state of hyaluronic acid production by recombinant bacterial and fungal organisms.",
