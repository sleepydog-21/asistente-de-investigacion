  "abstract": "Gene redundancy endows bacteria with enhanced adaptability to complex and fluctuating environments but results in genetic costs. Transcriptional regulation is considered an effective strategy for harmonizing adaptive benefits with physiological burdens. In our previous study, two redundant gene clusters (phbh1pcaApcaBorf404bhbR1 and phbh2pcaB2pcaA2bhbR2) involved in 3-bromo-4-hydroxybenzoate (3-Br-4-HB) catabolism were identified in In bacteria, catabolic genes for pollutant degradation often possess functionally redundant duplicates, providing a genetic basis for rapid adaptation to complex polluted environments. Synergic regulation plays an important role in balancing the physiological burden of extra genetic material with the adaptive benefits conferred by genetic redundancy. Although the co-existence of two redundant 3-bromo-4-hydroxybenzoate (3-Br-4-HB)-catabolic operons has been proven to enhance the metabolic robustness and adaptability of the host strain",
