  "abstract": "Expression of virulence genes in pathogenic Escherichia coli is controlled in part by the transcription silencer H-NS and its paralogs (e.g., StpA), which sequester DNA in multi-kb nucleoprotein filaments to inhibit transcription initiation, elongation, or both. Some activators counter-silence initiation by displacing H-NS from promoters, but how H-NS inhibition of elongation is overcome is not understood. In",
