  "abstract": "The continuous emergence of new illegal compounds, particularly psychoactive chemicals, poses significant challenges for current drug detection methods. Developing new protocols and kits for each new drug requires substantial time, effort, and dedicated manpower. Whole-cell bacterial bioreporters have been proven capable of detecting diverse hazardous compounds in both laboratory and field settings, identifying not only single compounds but also chemical families. We present the development of a microbial bioreporter for the detection of cocaine, the nervous system stimulant that is the second-most widely used illegal drug in the US.",
