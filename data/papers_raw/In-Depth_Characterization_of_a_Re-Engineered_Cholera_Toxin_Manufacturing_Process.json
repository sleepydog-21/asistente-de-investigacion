  "abstract": "Non-toxic derivatives of the cholera toxin are extensively used in neuroscience, as neuronal tracers to reveal the location of cells in the central nervous system. They are, also, being developed as vaccine components and drug-delivery vehicles. Production of cholera-toxin derivatives is often non-reproducible; the quality and quantity require extensive fine-tuning to produce them in lab-scale settings. In our studies, we seek a resolution to this problem, by expanding the molecular toolbox of the",
