  "abstract": "Klebsiella spp. commonly cause both uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) and recurrent UTI (rUTI). Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, a relatively newly defined species of Klebsiella, has been shown to be metabolically distinct from Klebsiella pneumoniae, but its type 1 and type 3 fimbriae have not been studied. K. pneumoniae uses both type 1 and type 3 fimbriae to attach to host epithelial cells. The type 1 fimbrial operon is well conserved between Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae apart from",
