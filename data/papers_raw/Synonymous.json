  "abstract": "Ionizing radiation (IR) in high doses is generally lethal to most organisms. Investigating mechanisms of radiation resistance is crucial for gaining insights into the underlying cellular responses and understanding the damaging effects of IR. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of sequencing data from an evolutionary experiment aimed at understanding the genetic adaptations to ionizing radiation in",
