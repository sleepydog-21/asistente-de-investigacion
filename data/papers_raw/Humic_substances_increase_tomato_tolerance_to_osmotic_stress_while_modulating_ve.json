  "abstract": "While humic substances (HS) are recognized for their role in enhancing plant growth under abiotic stress by modulating hormonal and redox metabolisms, a key question remains: how do HS influence the microbiota associated with plants? This study hypothesizes that the effects of HS extend beyond plant physiology, impacting the plant-associated bacterial community. To explore this, we investigated the combined and individual impacts of HS and osmotic stress on tomato plant physiology and root endophytic communities. Tomatoes were grown within a sterile hydroponic system, which allowed the experiment to focus on seed-transmitted endophytic bacteria. Moreover, sequencing the 16S-ITS-23S region of the",
