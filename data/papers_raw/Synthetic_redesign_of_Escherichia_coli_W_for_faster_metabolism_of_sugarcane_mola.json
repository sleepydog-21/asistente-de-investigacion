  "abstract": "Sugarcane molasses, rich in sucrose, glucose, and fructose, offers a promising carbon source for industrial fermentation due to its abundance and low cost. However, challenges arise from the simultaneous utilization of multiple sugars and carbon catabolite repression (CCR). Despite its nutritional content, sucrose metabolism in Escherichia coli, except for W strain, remains poorly understood, hindering its use in microbial fermentation. In this study, E. coli W was engineered to enhance sugar consumption rates and overcome CCR. This was achieved through the integration of a synthetically designed csc operon and the optimization of glucose and fructose co-utilization pathways. These advancements facilitate efficient utilization of sugarcane molasses for the production of 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP), contributing to sustainable biochemical production processes. In this study, we addressed challenges associated with sugar metabolism in E. coli W, focusing on enhancing sucrose consumption and improving glucose-fructose co-utilization. Through targeted engineering of the sucrose utilization system, we achieved accelerated sucrose consumption rates by modulating the expression of the csc operon components, cscB, cscK, cscA, and cscR. Our findings revealed that monocistronic expression of the csc genes with the deletion of cscR, led to optimal sucrose utilization without significant growth burden. Furthermore, we successfully alleviated fructose catabolite repression by modulating the binding dynamics of FruR with the fructose PTS regulon, enabling near-equivalent co-utilization of glucose and fructose. To validate the industrial applicability of our engineered strain, we pursued 3-HP production from sugarcane molasses. By integrating heterologous genes and optimizing metabolic pathways, we achieved improvements in 3-HP titers compared to previous studies. Additionally, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapA) repression aids in carbon flux redistribution, enhancing molasses conversion to 3-HP. Despite limitations in sucrose metabolism, the redesigned E. coli W strain, adept at utilizing sugarcane molasses, is a valuable asset for industrial fermentation. Its synthetic csc operon enhances sucrose consumption, while mitigating CCR improves glucose-fructose co-utilization. These enhancements, coupled with repression of gapA, aim to efficiently convert sugarcane molasses into 3-HP, addressing limitations in sucrose and fructose metabolism for industrial applications.",
