  "abstract": "Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) enable bacteria to acquire novel genes and traits. However, the functions of cargo genes within MGEs remain poorly understood. The cadmium resistance operon cadDX is present in many gram-positive bacteria. Although cadDX has been reported to be involved in metal detoxification, its regulatory mechanisms and functions in bacterial pathogenesis are poorly understood. This study revealed that cadDX contributes to cadmium resistance, oxidative stress resistance, and virulence in Streptococcus suis, an important zoonotic pathogen in pigs and humans. CadX represses cadD expression by binding to the cadDX promoter. Notably, cadX responds to H",
