  "abstract": "Transcription elongation by multi-subunit RNA polymerases (RNAPs) is regulated by auxiliary factors in all organisms. NusG/Spt5 is the only universally conserved transcription elongation factor shared by all domains of life. NusG is a component of antitermination complexes controlling ribosomal RNA operons, an essential antipausing factor, and a transcription-translation coupling factor in",
