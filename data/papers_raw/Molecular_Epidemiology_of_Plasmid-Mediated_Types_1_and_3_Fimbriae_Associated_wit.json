  "abstract": "Types 1 and 3 fimbriae in Enterobacteriaceae play versatile roles in bacterial physiology including attachment, invasion, cell motility as well as with biofilm formation and urinary tract infections. Herein, we investigated the prevalence and transmission of plasmid-mediated types 1 and 3 fimbriae from 1753 non-duplicate Enterobacteriaceae from diseased food Animals. We identified 123 (7.01%) strong biofilm producers and all was identified as",
