  "abstract": "Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is one of the most common causes of urinary tract infections. Here, we report for the first time the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and analysis of four extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL), UPEC sequence type (ST) 127 isolates that were recovered from patients in five hospitals in Armenia from January to August of 2019. A phylogenetic comparison revealed that our isolates were closely related to each other by their core and accessory genomes, despite having been isolated from different regions and hospitals in Armenia. We identified unique genes in our isolates and in a closely related isolate recovered in France. The unique genes (hemolysin E virulence gene, lactate utilization operon",
