  "abstract": "In biomanufacturing of surface-active agents, such as rhamnolipids, excessive foaming is a significant obstacle for the development of high-performing bioprocesses. The exploitation of the inherent tolerance of Pseudomonas putida KT2440, an obligate aerobic bacterium, to microaerobic conditions has received little attention so far. Here low-oxygen inducible promoters were characterized in biosensor strains and exploited for process control under reduction of foam formation by low aeration and stirring rates during biosynthesis of rhamnolipids. In this study, homologous promoters of P. putida inducible under oxygen limitation were identified by non-targeted proteomic analyses and characterized by fluorometric methods. Proteomics indicated a remodeling of the respiratory chain and the regulation of stress-related proteins under oxygen limitation. Of the three promoters tested in fluorescent biosensor assays, the promoter of the oxygen-sensitive cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidase gene showed high oxygen-dependent controllability. It was used to control the gene expression of a heterologous di-rhamnolipid synthesis operon in an auto-inducing microaerobic two-phase bioprocess. By limiting the oxygen supply via low aeration and stirring rates, the bioprocess was clearly divided into a growth and a production phase, and sources of foam formation were reduced. Accordingly, rhamnolipid synthesis did not have to be controlled externally, as the oxygen-sensitive promoter was autonomously activated as soon as the oxygen level reached microaerobic conditions. A critical threshold of about 20% oxygen saturation was determined. Utilizing the inherent tolerance of P. putida to microaerobic conditions in combination with the application of homologous, low-oxygen inducible promoters is a novel and efficient strategy to control bioprocesses. Fermentation under microaerobic conditions enabled the induction of rhamnolipid production by low oxygen levels, while foam formation was limited by low aeration and stirring rates.",
