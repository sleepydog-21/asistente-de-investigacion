  "abstract": "Some marine and extremophilic microorganisms are capable of synthesizing sulfated polysaccharides with a unique structure. A number of studies indicate significant biological properties of individual sulfated polysaccharides, such as antiproliferative activity, which makes them a promising area for further research. In this study, the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) was obtained from the bacterium",
