  "abstract": "The revolutionary CRISPR-Cas9 system leverages a programmable guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 proteins to precisely cleave problematic regions within DNA sequences. This groundbreaking technology holds immense potential for the development of targeted therapies for a wide range of diseases, including cancers, genetic disorders, and hereditary diseases. CRISPR-Cas9 based genome editing is a multi-step process such as designing a precise gRNA, selecting the appropriate Cas protein, and thoroughly evaluating both on-target and off-target activity of the Cas9-gRNA complex. To ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of CRISPR-Cas9 system, after the targeted DNA cleavage, the process requires careful analysis of the resultant outcomes such as indels and deletions. Following the success of artificial intelligence (AI) in various fields, researchers are now leveraging AI algorithms to catalyze and optimize the multi-step process of CRISPR-Cas9 system. To achieve this goal AI-driven applications are being integrated into each step, but existing AI predictors have limited performance and many steps still rely on expensive and time-consuming wet-lab experiments. The primary reason behind low performance of AI predictors is the gap between CRISPR and AI fields. Effective integration of AI into multi-step CRISPR-Cas9 system demands comprehensive knowledge of both domains. This paper bridges the knowledge gap between AI and CRISPR-Cas9 research. It offers a unique platform for AI researchers to grasp deep understanding of the biological foundations behind each step in the CRISPR-Cas9 multi-step process. Furthermore, it provides details of 80 available CRISPR-Cas9 system-related datasets that can be utilized to develop AI-driven applications. Within the landscape of AI predictors in CRISPR-Cas9 multi-step process, it provides insights of representation learning methods, machine and deep learning methods trends, and performance values of existing 50 predictive pipelines. In the context of representation learning methods and classifiers/regressors, a thorough analysis of existing predictive pipelines is utilized for recommendations to develop more robust and precise predictive pipelines.",
