Plant growth-promoting bacterium Rhizosphere microorganisms release vital signals that shape microbial communities, with antibiotics at low concentrations acting as intra- and interspecies signals. However, the mechanisms of these signals in coordinating gene expression are unclear. In non-pyoluteorin-producing",
