  "abstract": "Ubiquitination is a fundamental and highly conserved protein post-translational modification pathway, in which ubiquitin or a ubiquitin-like protein (Ubl) is typically conjugated to a lysine side chain of a target protein. Ubiquitination is a multistep process initiated by adenylation of the Ubl C-terminus, followed by sequential formation of 2-3 Ubl~cysteine thioester intermediates with E1, E2, and E3 proteins before formation of the final Ubl-lysine isopeptide bond",
