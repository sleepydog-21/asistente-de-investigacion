  "abstract": "Aromatic prenylated metabolites have important biological roles and activities in all living organisms. Compared to their importance in all domains of life, we know relatively little about their substrate scopes and metabolic functions. Here, we describe a new UbiA-like prenyltransferase (Ptase) Ubi-297 encoded in a conserved operon of several bacterial taxa, including marine Flavobacteria and the genus",
