  "abstract": "The gut microbiome plays a key role in bile acid (BA) metabolism, where a diversity of metabolic products contribute to human health and disease. In particular, Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is characterized by a low concentration of secondary bile acids (SBAs), whose transformation from primary bile acids (PBAs) is an essential function performed solely by gut bacteria. BA-transformation activity mediated by the bile acid inducible (bai) operon has been functionally characterized in the genus",
