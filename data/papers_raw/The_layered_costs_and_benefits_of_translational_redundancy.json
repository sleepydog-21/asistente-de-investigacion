  "abstract": "The rate and accuracy of translation hinges upon multiple components - including transfer RNA (tRNA) pools, tRNA modifying enzymes, and rRNA molecules - many of which are redundant in terms of gene copy number or function. It has been hypothesized that the redundancy evolves under selection, driven by its impacts on growth rate. However, we lack empirical measurements of the fitness costs and benefits of redundancy, and we have poor a understanding of how this redundancy is organized across components. We manipulated redundancy in multiple translation components of",
