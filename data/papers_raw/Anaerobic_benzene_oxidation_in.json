  "abstract": "Benzene is a widespread groundwater contaminant that persists under anoxic conditions. The aim of this study was to more accurately investigate anaerobic microbial degradation pathways to predict benzene fate and transport. Preliminary genomic analysis of The contamination of anaerobic subsurface environments including groundwater with toxic aromatic hydrocarbons, specifically benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene, has become a global issue. Subsurface groundwater is largely anoxic, and further study is needed to understand the natural attenuation of these compounds. This study elucidated a metabolic pathway utilized by the bacterium",
