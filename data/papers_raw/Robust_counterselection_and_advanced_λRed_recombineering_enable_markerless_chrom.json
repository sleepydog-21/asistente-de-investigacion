  "abstract": "Despite advances in bacterial genome engineering, delivery of large synthetic constructs remains challenging in practice. In this study, we propose a straightforward and robust approach for the markerless integration of DNA fragments encoding whole metabolic pathways into the genome. This approach relies on the replacement of a counterselection marker with cargo DNA cassettes via 位Red recombineering. We employed a counterselection strategy involving a genetic circuit based on the CI repressor of 位 phage. Our design ensures elimination of most spontaneous mutants, and thus provides a counterselection stringency close to the maximum possible. We improved the efficiency of integrating long PCR-generated cassettes by exploiting the Ocr antirestriction function of T7 phage, which completely prevents degradation of unmethylated DNA by restriction endonucleases in wild-type bacteria. The employment of highly restrictive counterselection and ocr-assisted 位Red recombineering allowed markerless integration of operon-sized cassettes into arbitrary genomic loci of four enterobacterial species with an efficiency of 50-100%. In the case of Escherichia coli, our strategy ensures simple combination of markerless mutations in a single strain via P1 transduction. Overall, the proposed approach can serve as a general tool for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering in a range of bacterial hosts.",
