  "abstract": "Traditional antimicrobial antibiotics are increasingly suffering from the emergence of multidrug resistance among pathogenic microorganisms. The antibiotic era is threatened by the ruthless rise of resistance in bacterial infections. A significant role in these resistance profiles is attributed to multidrug efflux pumps. Hence, much effort is being directed towards developing new compounds to overcome this problem. During our screening program of efflux pumps inhibitors (EPI) produced by bioactive Moroccan Actinobacteria, 210 isolates were screened for their antibacterial activities against",
