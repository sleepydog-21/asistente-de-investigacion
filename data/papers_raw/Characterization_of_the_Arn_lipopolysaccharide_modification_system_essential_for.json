  "abstract": "The zeamines produced by Dickeya oryzae are potent polyamine antibiotics and phytotoxins that are essential for bacterial virulence. We recently showed that the RND efflux pump DesABC in D. oryzae confers partial resistance to zeamines. To fully elucidate the bacterial self-protection mechanisms, in this study we used transposon mutagenesis to identify the genes encoding proteins involved in zeamine resistance in D. oryzae EC1. This led to the identification of a seven-gene operon, arn",
