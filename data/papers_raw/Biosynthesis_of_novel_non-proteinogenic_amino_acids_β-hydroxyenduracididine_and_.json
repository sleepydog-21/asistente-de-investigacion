  "abstract": "Non-proteinogenic amino acids (npAAs) are valuable building blocks for the development of advanced pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. The surge in interest in their synthesis is primarily due to the potential to enhance and diversify existing bioactive molecules. This can be achieved by altering these bioactive molecules to improve their effectiveness, reducing resistance compared to their natural counterparts or generating molecules with novel functions. Traditional production of npAAs in native hosts requires specialized conditions and complex cultivation media. Furthermore, these compounds are often found in organisms that challenge genetic manipulation. Thus, the recombinant production of these npAAs in a model organism like",
