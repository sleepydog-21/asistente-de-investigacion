  "abstract": "Bread is the oldest and most essential food consumed by humans, with its consumption exceeding nutritional needs and becoming part of cultural habits. Fermentation is an important step in the bread-making process, giving it its rheological, organoleptic, aromatic, and nutritional properties. Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts are both responsible for the fermentation step and part of the natural flour microbiota. In this study, we aimed to characterize LAB in three types of flour, namely, wheat, oat, and rice flour, using conventional phenotypic and biochemical assays and to carry out molecular-biology-based characterization via studying the",
