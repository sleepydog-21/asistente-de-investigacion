  "abstract": "Lambdoid bacteriophages are excellent models in studies on molecular aspects of virus-host interactions. However, some of them carry genes encoding toxins which are responsible for virulence of pathogenic strains of bacteria. Shiga toxin-converting bacteriophages (Stx phages) encode Shiga toxins that cause virulence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), and their effective production depends on Stx prophage induction. The exo-xis region of the lambdoid phage genome consists of genes which are dispensable for the phage multiplication under laboratory conditions; however, they might modulate the virus development. Nevertheless, their exact effects on the phage and host physiology remained unclear. Here, we present results of complex studies on the role of the exo-xis region of bacteriophage Φ24",
