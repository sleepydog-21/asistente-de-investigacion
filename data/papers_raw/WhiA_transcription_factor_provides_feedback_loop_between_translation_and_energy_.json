  "abstract": "WhiA is a conserved protein found in numerous bacteria. It consists of an HTH DNA-binding domain linked with a homing endonuclease (HEN) domain. WhiA is one of the most conserved transcription factors in reduced bacteria of the class Mollicutes. Its function in Mollicutes is unknown, while it is well-characterized in We used a combination molecular dynamics, EMSA, MST and AFM to study the DNA-binding and ATP-binding properties of WhiA from We demonstrate that WhiA homolog from M. gallisepticum binds a conserved sequence of the GAYACRCY core (Y = C or T, R = A or G), which is located in the promoter of an operon coding for ribosomal proteins and adenylate kinase ( We propose the following model for",
