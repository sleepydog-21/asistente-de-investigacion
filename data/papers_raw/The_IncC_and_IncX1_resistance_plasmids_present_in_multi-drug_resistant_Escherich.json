  "abstract": "The study describes the whole-genome sequencing of two antibiotic-resistant representative Escherichia coli strains, isolated from poultry manure in 2020. The samples were obtained from a commercial chicken meat production facility in Poland. The antibiotic resistance profile was characterized by co-resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. The three identified resistance plasmids (R-plasmids), pECmdr13.2, pECmdr13.3, and pECmdr14.1, harbored various genes conferring resistance to tetracyclines (tetR[A]) for, aminoglycoside (aph, aac, and aad families), β-lactam (bla",
