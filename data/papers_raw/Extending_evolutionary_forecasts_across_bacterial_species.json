  "abstract": "Improving evolutionary forecasting requires progressing from studying repeated evolution of a single genotype under identical conditions to formulating broad principles. These principles should enable predictions of how similar species will adapt to similar selective pressures. Evolve-and-resequence experiments with multiple species allow testing forecasts on different biological levels and elucidating the causes for failed predictions. Here, we show that forecasts for adaptation to static culture conditions can be extended to multiple species by testing previous predictions for",
