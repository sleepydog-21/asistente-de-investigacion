  "abstract": "Xylose is a five-carbon sugar and the second abundant mono-saccharide in lignocellulosic biomass. Xylose is not only a sugar substitute by itself, but also a good carbon source for the microbial and enzymatic synthesis of various valuable biomaterials. Most microorganisms are able to uptake and consume xylose as a sole carbon source because they possess specific transport systems and metabolic enzymes.",
