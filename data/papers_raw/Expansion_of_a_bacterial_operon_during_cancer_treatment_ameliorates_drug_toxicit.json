Herein, we demonstrate the utility of a more comprehensive approach to studying drug toxicity through longitudinal study of the human gut microbiome during colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment (NCT04054908) coupled to cell culture and mouse experiments. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed significant shifts in gut microbial community structure during oral fluoropyrimidine treatment across multiple patient cohorts, in mouse small and large intestinal contents, and in patient-derived",
