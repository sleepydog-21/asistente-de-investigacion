  "abstract": "Adherence to both cellular and abiotic surfaces is a crucial step in the interaction of bacterial pathogens and commensals with their hosts. Bacterial surface structures known as fimbriae or pili play a fundamental role in the early colonization stages by providing specificity or tropism. Among the various fimbrial families, the chaperone-usher family has been extensively studied due to its ubiquity, diversity, and abundance. This family is named after the components that facilitate their biogenesis. Type 1 fimbria and P pilus, two chaperone-usher fimbriae associated with urinary tract infections, have been thoroughly investigated and serve as prototypes that have laid the foundations for understanding the biogenesis of this fimbrial family. Additionally, the study of the mechanisms regulating their expression has also been a subject of great interest, revealing that the regulation of the expression of the genes encoding these structures is a complex and diverse process, involving both common global regulators and those specific to each operon.",
