  "abstract": "Carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-hvKP) has received considerable attention. Typically, the genetic elements that confer virulence are harbored by nonconjugative plasmids. In this study, we report a CR-hvKP strain, CY814036, of high-risk sequence type 25 (ST25) and the K2 serotype, which is uncommon among K. pneumoniae isolates but caused serious lung infection in a tertiary teaching hospital in China. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) revealed a rare conjugative plasmid, pCY814036-iucA, carrying a virulence-associated",
