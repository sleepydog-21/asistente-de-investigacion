  "abstract": "Despite dramatic advances in genomics, connecting genotypes to phenotypes is still challenging. Sexual genetics combined with linkage analysis is a powerful solution to this problem but generally unavailable in bacteria. We build upon a strong negative selection system to invent mass allelic exchange (MAE), which enables hybridization of arbitrary (including pathogenic) strains of",
