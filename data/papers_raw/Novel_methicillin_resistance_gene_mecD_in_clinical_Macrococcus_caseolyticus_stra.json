  "abstract": "Methicillin-resistant Macrococcus caseolyticus strains from bovine and canine origins were found to carry a novel mecD gene conferring resistance to all classes of β-lactams including anti-MRSA cephalosporins. Association of β-lactam resistance with mecD was demonstrated by gene expression in S. aureus and deletion of the mecD-containing island in M. caseolyticus. The mecD gene was located either on an 18,134-bp M. caseolyticus resistance island (McRI",
