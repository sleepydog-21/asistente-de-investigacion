  "abstract": "Small genetic elements known as toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are abundant in bacterial genomes and involved in stress response, phage inhibition, mobile genetic elements maintenance and biofilm formation. Type II TA systems are the most abundant and diverse, and they are organized as bicistronic operons that code for proteins (toxin and antitoxin) able to interact through a nontoxic complex. However, HicAB is one of the type II TA systems that remains understudied. Here, we review the current knowledge of HicAB systems in different bacteria, their main characteristics and the existing evidence to associate them with some biological roles, are described. The accumulative evidence reviewed here, though modest, underscores that HicAB systems are underexplored TA systems with significant potential for future research.",
