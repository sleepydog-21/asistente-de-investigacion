  "abstract": "Host nutritional immunity utilizes metal deprivation to help prevent microbial infection. To investigate bacterial adaptation to such restrictive conditions, we conducted experimental evolution with two metal sequestering agents. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and diethylenetriamine pentamethylene phosphonic acid (DTPMP) were selected as ligands because they differentially affect cellular levels of iron, manganese and zinc in",
