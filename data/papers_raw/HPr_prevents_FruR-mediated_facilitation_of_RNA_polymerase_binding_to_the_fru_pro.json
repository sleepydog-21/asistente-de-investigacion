  "abstract": "Phosphorylation state-dependent interactions of the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) components with transcription factors play a key role in carbon catabolite repression (CCR) by glucose in bacteria. Glucose inhibits the PTS-dependent transport of fructose and is preferred over fructose in Vibrio cholerae, but the mechanism is unknown. We have recently shown that, contrary to Escherichia coli, the fructose-dependent transcriptional regulator FruR acts as an activator of the fru operon in V. cholerae and binding of the FruR-fructose 1-phosphate (F1P) complex to an operator facilitates RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding to the fru promoter. Here we show that, in the presence of glucose, dephosphorylated HPr, a general PTS component, binds to FruR. Whereas HPr does not affect DNA-binding affinity of FruR, regardless of the presence of F1P, it prevents the FruR-F1P complex from facilitating the binding of RNAP to the fru promoter. Structural and biochemical analyses of the FruR-HPr complex identify key residues responsible for the V. cholerae-specific FruR-HPr interaction not observed in E. coli. Finally, we reveal how the dephosphorylated HPr interacts with FruR in V. cholerae, whereas the phosphorylated HPr binds to CcpA, which is a global regulator of CCR in Bacillus subtilis and shows structural similarity to FruR.",
