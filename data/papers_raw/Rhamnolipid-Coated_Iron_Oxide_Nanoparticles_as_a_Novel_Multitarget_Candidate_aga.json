  "abstract": "Surface-growing antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus are emerging as a global health challenge due to dilemmas in clinical treatment. Furthermore, their pathogenesis, including increasingly serious antimicrobial resistance and biofilm formation, makes them challenging to treat by conventional therapy. Therefore, the development of novel antivirulence strategies will undoubtedly provide a path forward in combatting these resistant bacterial infections. In this regard, we developed novel biosurfactant-coated nanoparticles to combine the antiadhesive/antibiofilm properties of rhamnolipid (RHL)-coated Fe",
