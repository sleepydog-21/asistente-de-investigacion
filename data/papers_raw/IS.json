  "abstract": "Polymyxins [colistin and polymyxin B (PMB)] comprise an important class of natural product lipopeptide antibiotics used to treat multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections. These positively charged lipopeptides interact with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) located in the outer membrane and disrupt the permeability barrier, leading to increased uptake and bacterial cell death. Many bacteria counter polymyxins by upregulating genes involved in the biosynthesis and transfer of amine-containing moieties to increase positively charged residues on LPS. Although 4-deoxy-l-aminoarabinose (Ara4N) and phosphoethanolamine (PEtN) are highly conserved LPS modifications in",
