  "abstract": "Bacteria use antiphage systems to combat phages, their ubiquitous competitors, and evolve new defenses through repeated reshuffling of basic functional units into novel reformulations. A common theme is generating a nucleotide-derived second messenger in response to phage that activates an effector protein to halt virion production. Phages respond with counter-defenses that deplete these second messengers, leading to an escalating arms race with the host. Here we discover a novel antiphage system we call Panoptes that detects phage infection by surveying the cytosol for phage proteins that antagonize the nucleotide-derived second messenger pool. Panoptes is a two-gene operon,",
