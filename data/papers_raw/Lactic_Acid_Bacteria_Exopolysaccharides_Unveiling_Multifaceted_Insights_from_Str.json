  "abstract": "Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) exopolysaccharides (EPSs) have garnered significant scientific interest due to their multifaceted roles in food technology and health promotion. This comprehensive review systematically examines the structural classification of LAB EPSs, emphasizing distinctions between homo-and heteropolysaccharides, as well as the influence of substituent groups (e. g., acetyl, phosphate) on their physicochemical and bioactive properties. Advanced isolation methodologies, including ethanol precipitation and ultrafiltration, coupled with characterization techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM), are vital for deciphering their chemical and physical characteristics. The biosynthesis pathway, governed by",
