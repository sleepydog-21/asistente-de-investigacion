  "abstract": "Since Jacob and Monod's discovery of the lac operon âˆ¼1960, the explanations offered for most metabolic adaptations have been genetic. The focus has been on the adaptive changes in gene expression that occur, which are often referred to as \"metabolic reprogramming.\" The contributions metabolism makes to adaptation have been largely ignored. Here we point out that metabolic adaptations, including the associated changes in gene expression, are highly dependent on the metabolic state of an organism prior to the environmental change to which it is adapting, and on the plasticity of that state. In support of this hypothesis, we examine the paradigmatic example of a genetically driven adaptation, the adaptation of",
