    "pregunta": "what is a dog?",
    "respuesta": "A dog is a domesticated mammal of the species Canis lupus familiaris. It belongs to the Canidae family, which also includes wolves, foxes, and other similar animals. Dogs are known for their varied sizes, shapes, and colors, and they have been selectively bred by humans over thousands of years for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.\n\nDogs are highly social animals and are known for their loyalty and companionship towards humans. They play various roles in human societies, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding disabled individuals. This influence on human society has given them the nickname \"man's best friend\" in the Western world.\n\nIn terms of biology, dogs are carnivorous mammals with a body plan suited to running and active hunting. They have a highly developed sense of smell and acute hearing. Domestic dogs are distinguished from their wild ancestors and other canids due to their synanthropic behaviors, as they thrive in a human environment.\n\nSource: General knowledge and widely accepted scientific consensus on the domestication and characteristics of dogs.",
